Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.\n##  Highlights\n###  Erts:\n* Enhanced IO scalability\n* Support for usage of distribution controller processes for alternative transports, routing etc\n* compact instructions on 64bit systems for code below 4GB 20% less memory for loaded code\n* Rewrite of the efile-driver with NIFs and \"Dirty schedulers\" resulting in faster file operations\n* non-smp VM removed\n* link and monitor optimized for scalability\n* os:getenv/putenv now work on thread-safe emulation. No longer in sync with libc getenv(3). Manual synchronization will be needed.\n### Compiler:\n* Misc compiler optimizations including contributions from the Elixir team resulting in 10% improvements in benchmarks\n* \"Tuple calls\" have been removed from the run-time system.\n* Code such as `f({ok, Val}) -> {ok, Val}` is now automatically rewritten to `f({ok, Val} = Tuple) -> Tuple.` this reduces code size, execution time, and removed GC pressure.\n* More information in stacktrace from a number of operators\n* `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` deprecated to be replaced with `try ... catch C:R:Stacktrace -> ...`\n* Creation of small maps with literal keys optimized.\n### Security:\n* DTLS support in SSL\n* Enhanced support for distribution over TLS\n* \"unsecure\" ciphers removed from defaults in SSL and SSH.\n* A new option value defined to facilitate implementing exec servers. Old option kept for compatibility, but now gives errors on stderror.\n### Standard libraries:\n* New API for logging, logger\n* New uri_string module for parsing URIs according to \"The standard\"\n* New function lists:search(list,fun/1) -> {ok, Value} | false\n* Changed default behaviour of .erlang loading. escript, erlc, dialyzer and typer no longer load an .erlang at all.\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_21.0-rc1.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_21.0-rc1.readme)\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_21.0-rc1.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_21.0-rc1.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_21.0-rc1.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_21.0-rc1.exe)\n\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-10.0-rc1/doc](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-10.0-rc1/doc)\n\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\n\n[https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n\n[OTP-21.0-rc1](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-21.0-rc1)\n\n \n\nThank you for all your contributions!\n\n \n","tags":["release candidate"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
