The Erlang User Conference (EUC) has been rebranded as Code BEAMSTO. It is still a two-day, multi-track event on Erlang programming language with elements of Elixir and other BEAM languages. We focus on real-world applications of Erlang, concurrency, distributed computing and scalability. We strive to bring together people passionate about the Erlang Ecosystem and high-performance, massively scalable distributed systems.   

 Join us between 31 May - 1 June, with a free day of tutorials. There are also many in-depth training options available, find out more on the website: [https://www.codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2018/](https://www.codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2018/)
