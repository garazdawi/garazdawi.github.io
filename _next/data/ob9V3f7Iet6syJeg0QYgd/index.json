This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.\n* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.\n* **SSL**:\n * Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification\n* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\n * `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\n* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.\n* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.\n Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for existing code\n* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\n* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.\n* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\n* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\n* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\n* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\n* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\n functions are:\n * `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.\n* `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.\n The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\n* **kernel**: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\n* Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.\n \nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0.readme)\n \nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0.exe)\n \nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0/doc](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0/doc)\n The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\n [https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n \n","author":"Kenneth","attachment":"abs","tags":["release","OTP 23"]},{"id":"139","title":"OTP 23 Release Candidate 3","article_date":1587513600000,"lead":"The last release candidate for OTP 23","frontmatter":{"id":"139","title":"OTP 23 Release Candidate 3","lead":"The last release candidate for OTP 23","tags":"releasecandidate","article_date":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2020-05-11T08:05:11Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T08:05:11Z","admin_user_id":"3","visible":"true","article_type_id":"3"},"content":" ## OTP 23 Release Candidate 3\n \nThis is the third and last of three planned release candidates before the OTP 23 release.\n The intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. **All feedback is welcome**, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\n \nErlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.\n ### Highlights (rc3)\n \nApart from the changes below, this third pre-release contains only minor fixes.\n ### Potential Incompatibilities\n * SSL: * Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.\n* TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.\n* `erl_interface`: Removed the deprecated parts of `erl_interface`\n (`erl_interface.h` and essentially all C functions with prefix `erl_`).\n* The deprecated `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace.\n `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\n* ...\n ### Highlights (rc2)\n * **ssh**: * OpenSSH 6.5 introduced a new file representation of\n keys called `openssh-key-v1`.

base16 encoding and decoding was introduced in https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/3014, I'm now proposing a more performant algorithm. Regardless of the input size, encoding is generally 2x-3x faster, and decoding 1.5x-2x faster. The biggest difference is in memory consumption, where both are constant 128B memory consumption, while the original algorithm grows the heap linearly to the input size. Details below. This algorithm is also very much similar to what Elixir does in https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/76d245b6081c53228bf99fc1494add5de7872065/lib/elixir/lib/base.ex\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBenchmarked using benchee with this code:\r\n```elixir\r\nBenchee.run(\r\n  %{\r\n    \"encode optimised\" => fn input -> :bench_erl.encode(input) end,\r\n    \"encode otp\" => fn input -> :bench_erl.encode_hex(input) end\r\n  },\r\n  inputs: %{\r\n    \"1.

of the nicest side effects of the JIT is that it allows us to use off-the-shelf profilers like `perf`, which have far lower overhead than our own (e.g. `fprof`). Unfortunately they can't always follow what happens due to lack of debug information and frame pointers, making the results somewhat incomplete.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to get halfway there using `perf`'s last-branch-record (`--call-graph=lbr`) mode that uses processor-specific features to figure out which functions call each other. We've found it very useful but unfortunately it only works on Intel processors, tends to be disabled in virtualized environments (Intel or not), and it can attribute execution time to the wrong functions since it interprets process rescheduling as a function call.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds frame pointers when `perf` support is turned on (`+JPperf true`), letting us use the frame pointer mode (`--call-graph=fp`) which has none of the above

adds function `logger:reconfigure/0` that allows to reset logger configuration to what is configured in `kernel` application configuration. This function is meant to be used by build/run tools like Rebar3 or Mix to provide \"production-like\" way to configure logging in reliable way.\r\n\r\nThis function is obviously not safe to be called during application runtime, as it may cause losing some log messages, but it is by far better solution than what we have now, where [Rebar3 tries to reimplement such functionality on their own](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/blob/8adc139818191542ca9e110f13f78adcd4d83daf/src/rebar_utils.erl#L489) (risking incompatibilities if `logger` configuration will be expanded one day) or just ignore it, and requires users to configure logging on their own (like Mix does, that just relies that users will use Elixir's Logger). Lack of such functionality prevents Elixir from further integration with Erlang's Logger.\r\n\r\nRef elixir-lang/elixir#10791

etp macros only work for gdb and Apple has made it almost impossible to install gdb, so in order to debug on OS X we need working lldb macros.\r\n\r\nThis commit ports the most important macros to lldb so that we can more easily do some basic debugging. The commands ported are:\r\n\r\n* etp-processes\r\n* etp-process-info\r\n* etp-stacktrace\r\n* etp-stackdump\r\n* etp (Also lldb's type formatter is used to print Eterm)\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\n(lldb) bt\r\n* thread #5, name = '1_scheduler', stop reason = step in\r\n  * frame #0: 0x00005555556d5257 beam.smp`do_send(p=0x00007fffb4cc0a88, to=0x500b init, \r\n

in progress: no tests yet_\r\n\r\nThis PR implements custom hello extensions -- a way the user\r\ncan add extensions encoders and decoders without having to modify\r\nssl code.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\nFor example, this module implements two extensions with types `16#4201` and `16#4202`:\r\n```\r\n-module(example_ext).\r\n-export(encode_extension/3, decode_extension/4]).\r\n\r\n-spec encode_extension(Type::integer(), CbOpts::any(), Context::map()) ->\r\n    binary() | {last, binary()} | undefined.\r\nencode_extension(16#4201, #{custom_01 := V}, _) ->\r\n    &lt;&lt;V:16&gt;&gt;;\r\nencode_extension(16#4202, #{custom_02 := V}, #{version := {3,3}) ->\r\n    {last, &lt;&lt;\"test\", V:16&gt;&gt;};\r\nencode_extension(16#4202, _, _} ->\r\n    undefined.\r\n\r\n-spec decode_extension(Type::integer(), ExtData::binary(), Context::map()) ->\r\n    {Key::atom(), any()} | undefined.\r\ndecode_extension(16#4201, &lt;&lt;V:16&gt;&gt;, _) ->\r\n    {custom_01, #{custom_01 => V}};\r\ndecode_extension(16#4202, &lt;&lt;_:4/binary, V:16&gt;&gt;, #{version := {3,3}) ->\r\n    {test, V};\r\ndecode_extension(16#4202, _, _) ->\r\n    undefined.\r\n```\r\nUser may send and receive extensions in server/client hello:\r\n```\r\nCustomExts = {[16#4201, 16#4202], example_ext, #{custom_01 => 78, custom_02 => 9873}},\r\n{ok, S, Ext} = ssl:connect(\"localhost\", 12345, [{custom_extensions, CustomExts}, {handshake, hello}]),\r\n#{test := T} = Ext\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may be also useful for testing (e.g. add or remove some extensions to see how the other side reacts to this).","created_at":"2021-03-17T19:52:35Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T08:30:40Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86b57a0a2fa1ac1983df800907a13dfc2876bf16","assignee":{"login":"IngelaAndin","id":294507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDUwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/294507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin","html_url":"https://github.com/IngelaAndin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"IngelaAndin","id":294507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDUwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/294507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin","html_url":"https://github.com/IngelaAndin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IngelaAndin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356265357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjUzNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:PS","name":"team:PS","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

commit adds two options to the erl_call command line tool:\r\n\r\n* -fetch_stdout\r\n  Executes the given code (provided by the -a or -e options) in a new\r\n  process with a group leader that forwards all stdout (standard\r\n  output) data so that it is printed to stdout of the erl_call\r\n  process. This means that stdout data that is written during the\r\n  execution of the called code, by the code and by descendant\r\n  processes, will be forwarded (given that the group leader has not\r\n  been changed by a call to erlang:group_leader/2). The printed data\r\n  is UTF-8 encoded.\r\n* -no_result_term\r\n  This option disables printing of the result term.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement the first of these two options a new function\r\ncalled ei_xrpc_from has been added to erl_interface. This function is\r\ndocumented in the erl_interface documentation.","created_at":"2021-03-16T08:31:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T11:21:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"604352f5ff9322d9840c7116c750a692af588fe2","assignee":{"login":"kjellwinblad","id":200374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDM3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad","html_url":"https://github.com/kjellwinblad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kjellwinblad","id":200374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDM3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad","html_url":"https://github.com/kjellwinblad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

is a suggestion that needs to be evaluated.  The concept popped up in the discussion of #4564 and I happened to have this branch already.\r\n\r\nI have rewritten the `inet_res` DNS resolver to query name servers in parallel, which seems to be the contemporary way to do it.\r\n\r\nTo avoid wasting resources there is a delay of half the normal UDP time-out before a new name server is queried, so the queries are not entirely parallel.  The question is if this is too defensive?\r\n\r\nTo ensure process cleanup there is a Reaper process started for every query, and all queries are performed in parallel processes.  That means at least 2 processes are spawned for a query, and then after half the normal UDP time-out another is spawned up to 1 process per name server + the Reaper.  The question is if this expending too much resources - I did not find a better way to do it.\r\n\r\nBecause queries are done in parallel this algorithm uses more sockets i.e more IP Ports and more file descriptors.  The current algorithm uses one UDP socket, and possibly one TCP socket if needed.  This algorithm uses one socket per query process which go up to one per name server.  The question is if this might be a problem for systems where IP Ports or file descriptors are a scarce resource.\r\n\r\nSo, is this a good improvement, or wasting resources?","created_at":"2021-03-10T09:04:30Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T13:29:58Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58b8904c77247ef191301e333365c4a95155025e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356265357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjUzNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:PS","name":"team:PS","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

per discussion in #3027 @dgud @garazdawi this is adding a windows CI build based on Github Windows image + WSL.\r\n\r\nThis build skips building the docs intentionally but produces a Windows installer with all apps (including wxWidgets 3.1.4 and WebView2).\r\n\r\nIt's not signing any of the executables, but it's definitely good enough to see whether everything still compiles and for quick downloading and testing.\r\n\r\nCheers!","created_at":"2021-03-09T18:06:43Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T11:21:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae977a2bc9d240d7a961925936418f366f5261dc","assignee":{"login":"garazdawi","id":111762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi","html_url":"https://github.com/garazdawi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"garazdawi","id":111762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi","html_url":"https://github.com/garazdawi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dgud","id":80937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud","html_url":"https://github.com/dgud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgud/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"garazdawi","id":111762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi","html_url":"https://github.com/garazdawi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garazdawi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356265357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjUzNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:PS","name":"team:PS","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

was bold enough to start a pet-project refactoring the `erl_prettypr.erl` module. This has been a long-time coming and **I still consider it Work-In-Progress**. Never-the-less, I thought I'd share the current state to see if there's interest in this work.\r\n\r\nI plan to:\r\n* Rebase the branch and write meaningful commit-messages\r\n* Expand on the documentation\r\n* Extend the tests to verify the formatted layout as opposed to the current verification of compile-abilty\r\n\r\nFurther-more:\r\n* Make the layout more configurable\r\n* Keep macro-s as is. - I've noticed macro-s are converted, this should be disabled by default, but optional.\r\n* Create alternative callbacks, to the current `hook`, these functions would be specific for each Tree-type.\r\n* ... I'm open to suggestions\r\n\r\nI'm aware that there have been attempts to \"fix-up\" this module and those attempts ended-up in separate stand-alone projects. Despite of that I think there still is a value in improving the code-formatter shipped with Erlang/OTP, as it may be used by other internal libraries.\r\n\r\nI've decided to simplify the module before attempting to expand on the Layout-Configurability. So, I consider this PR as stage-1 to be honest towards the end-goal: \"Make the layout configurable.\" - Solving the leading-comma formatting would be a good driving principle for configurabilty.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of similarities between Erlang statements, like case-clauses and function-clauses, or between data-structure like lists, tuples and binaries, so I've tried to collapse these cases into one, so that they have the same layout.\r\n\r\nThe produced code-layout relies only on what's possible with the `prettypr`. Only the 4 different layouts: `sep/1`, `par/1`, `above/2` and `beside/2` are used. These are surprisingly versatile and I've found the `float` layout nondeterministic (don't really understand how it supposed to work).\r\n\r\nWith this PR a simple, sensible layout is produced for those who just want it to work without any

the moment, Erlang does not fully support IEEE-754\r\nencoding in binary matching. In particular, it is not\r\npossible to decode/encode infinity, negative infinity,\r\nand nan's.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all of the arithmetic operations in Erlang\r\nraise in the presence of the values above.\r\n\r\nThe IEEE-754 standard makes a strong case for *not*\r\nraising when working with non-finite values - but we can\r\nprobably say this ship has sailed for Erlang. Furthermore,\r\none can assume that, if those features were desired by\r\nthe community, they would already have been implemented.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this patch proposes to allow encoding/decoding\r\nof non-finite values. After all, if a non-finite value was\r\nencoded as part of a binary, it was likely expected that\r\nthe decoding party should handle it. This pull request adds\r\nbasic mechanisms to do so.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this pull request does not change\r\n(nor intends to) any of the arithmetic operations. Therefore,\r\noperations that raised in the past when returning non-finite\r\nvalues continue to behave the same.\r\n\r\nA possible venue for exploration in a later pull request\r\nis to augment the math module with IEEE compatible functions,\r\nfor example, `math:ieee_log/1`, `math:ieee_exp/1`, as well as\r\n`math:ieee_add/2`, `math:ieee_subtract/2` and so forth\r\n(including `math:ieee_negate/1`) that supports non-finite\r\nvalues. This would allow Erlang developers to work with\r\nnon-finite values if they want to and allow them to do so\r\nefficiently (currently it is inefficient and cumbersome).\r\n\r\nI am submitting this pull request for a initial request for\r\ncomments. In particular, I want to show supporting non-finite\r\nvalues seems to be trivial, given this is handled by any C\r\ntoolchain that supports IEEE-754 (which is commonplace).\r\nI will work on tests if there is interest.","created_at":"2021-02-19T12:18:53Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T14:54:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b73ef64edfa816acd6449a5ef16e2fa35031005","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

goal of this pull request is to provide a mechanism to ease static analysis (e.g. `xref` and `dialyzer`) for implementations of `parse_transform`s.\r\n\r\nTo this end:\r\n1. I add a new `parse_transform.erl` module,\r\n2. I add a documentation page for this module,\r\n3. I reference this documentation from `compile.xml`.\r\n\r\nWhat's missing?\r\n- [ ] understanding if this is something we want in OTP,\r\n- [ ] understanding if the behaviour-defining module name is acceptable,\r\n- [ ] understanding if the documentation should be in the `compiler` namespace\r\n- [ ] understanding if the new behaviour should be declared in modules like `merl_transform`, `ms_transform`, ...\r\n\r\n**Note** on the motivation for this: I was going through some lib.s that implement parse transformations, looking at OTP 24, and figured that the recent change to the compiler's line v. line/col output would be sometimes difficult to achieve, but `dialyzer` could help if there were a well defined behaviour for this, and also not to have to add `rebar3`-specific `ignore_xref` where a parse_transform is defined.","created_at":"2021-02-06T04:35:43Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T16:43:53Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3cf93d232446cc9130d31e6f0501ee790a9f22e","assignee":{"login":"uabboli","id":133709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli","html_url":"https://github.com/uabboli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"uabboli","id":133709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli","html_url":"https://github.com/uabboli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uabboli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

on https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/3020.\r\n\r\nThis allows the quoted source code in error messages to underline the range of the error, and can also be used by tools that display source code, as in an IDE.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nfoo.erl:18:16: illegal guard expression\r\n%   18| foo(A, B) when is_lit(A), is_list(B) ->\r\n%     |                ^^^^^^\r\n```\r\ninstead of

Adding further support for the scanner to annotate all tokens with end position right away would save the time now spent calculating end positions of tokens by taking the length of the

current implementation of `edoc` places an Erlang logo and a link to `http://www.erlang.org/` in the top/bottom right corners of all generated overview and module pages. This has always bothered me, since (to me at least) it suggests that the documented modules are in some way related to Erlang _as an organization_, while most of the time it really is just some software _written_ in Erlang. For an example, see [the API documentation for MySQL-OTP](https://mysql-otp.github.io/mysql-otp/), which is a MySQL driver written in/for Erlang, but otherwise has no relation to Erlang as such.\r\n\r\nThe logo and link are hardcoded into the `edoc_layout` module, and there is no easy way to change it other than post-processing the generated files (something which I guess is being done with [the API documentation for PropEr](http://proper.softlab.ntua.gr/doc/)) or maybe some CSS/JS trickery.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the `@vendor` tag for the overview and module pages in to allow customization of the link and logo, with the following semantics (when using the standard layout that comes with `edoc`):\r\n* if the `@vendor` tag is absent, the layout renders the Erlang logo and the link to `http://www.erlang.org/` as it does now. While this is actually counter-intuitive, this behavior is required to keep backwards compatibility, especially with software that post-processes the generated files in order to replace the logo and link with their own\r\n* if the `@vendor` tag is present but empty, the layout renders no logo or link, ie \"no vendor\"\r\n* if the `@vendor` tag is present and not empty, it _must_  contain the vendor name, and _may_ optionally contain a website URI (ie, link to vendor website) in square brackets (`[...]`) and/or a logo URI (ie. the URI of a logo image) in angle brackets (`<...>`), in any order (or rather, the same ordering rules as for the `@author` tags apply). This information is used by the standard layout to render what is displayed in the top/bottom right corners instead of the Erlang logo/link according to the following rules:\r\n  * if only the name is given (no website or logo URIs), only that name appears\r\n  * if a logo URI is given, the logo appears, and the name is placed in the `alt` attribute of the `img` tag\r\n  * if a website URI is given, the name or logo, a link is placed on the name or logo\r\n\r\nThere is a slight difference between the current (or the equivalent no-@vendor-tag) behavior and the one introduced with the `@vendor` tag: The Erlang logo is copied to the location of the generated documentation (ie, it is _part of_ the documentation), while logo images denoted via the `@vendor` tag are not.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nAbout the same could be achieved by introducing a new `{vendor, ...}` option instead of a new `@vendor` tag. This way, a mechanism to copy a logo image to the documentation would probably be easy to implement as well. On the other hand, it takes the vendor information out of the source files and places it in the hands of the caller. For this reason, I decided against it, but I'm open to suggestions of course

allows you to annotate already-bound pattern variables as ^X, like in Elixir. This is less error prone when code is being refactored and moved around so that variables previously new in a pattern may become bound, or vice versa, and makes it easier for the reader to see the intent of the code. An new compiler flag 'warn_unpinned_vars' (disabled by default) provides warnings for all uses of already bound variables in patterns that have not been marked with ^.\r\n\r\nNote that this branch is a preview, and is based on another branch (#2944) to avoid future complications. Only the last commit pertains to this

First of all, this workflow file is isolated (it just uses [init-pre-release.sh](.github/scripts/init-pre-release.sh) for now) and there’s more work to be done to re-use existing scripts\r\n\r\n- As a proof of concept, the workflow currently only builds on pushes to the “master” branch and the artifacts are attached to the action run, see e.g.: https://github.com/wojtekmach/otp/actions/runs/428356220. Instead of building on every push to master, there could be instead a “nightly” job for master. If these master/nightly/etc artifacts would prove useful, instead of just being attached to the job, should they have a more permanent home e.g. on erlang.org? Btw, looks like run artifacts are only accessible to users who have access to the repo, so I re-published the tarballs that were built in that action here: http://wojtekmach.pl/otp/. In particular, you can easily test it with Docker by running: `docker run -it --rm ubuntu:20.04 sh -c 'apt update && apt install -y curl && curl http://wojtekmach.pl/otp/master-x86_64-ubuntu-20.04.tar.gz | tar xz && cd release/ && ./Install -sasl $PWD && ./bin/erl'`\r\n\r\n- Beyond this proof of concept that just builds master branch, and this is really the point of all this work, there will be a job that works on releases (tbd how it’s triggered: either on tag push, or on release creation, or by polling, etc) that will attach the artifacts to *the release*, this way the artifacts will be available under predictable and *public* URLs like: https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-24.0/OTP-24.0-x86_64-macos-10.15.tar.gz\r\n\r\n- When downloading the run artifacts on macOS using Safari, the tarball is put under quarantine which means you won’t be able run executables unless you allow it in security settings. You can work around it by running this before unpacking the tarball: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine path/to/tar`. When we have tarballs attached to releases, they could be downloaded via curl (since we can guess the URL) and that way they won’t be quarantined. Thus, when tools like asdf-erlang/kerl/etc will use binary releases, they’ll simply use curl to fetch and it will just work. I’m not sure people would download release from GitHub via browser, after unpacking you still need to run the `./Install` script, so maybe the curl-based flow is enough. Otherwise, it would probably make sense to build (and sign) a gui installer.\r\n\r\n- I’ve arbitrarily picked the naming scheme to be: `<ref>-<arch>-<os>-<osversion>.tar.gz`,\r\n  - master-x86_64-alpine-3.12.tar.gz\r\n  - master-x86_64-macos-10.15.tar.gz\r\n  - master-x86_64-ubuntu-20.04.tar.gz\r\n\r\n  Does that seem reasonable? Not sure if it should be more specific (e.g. instead darwin-19.6.0 for macOS Catalina)\r\n\r\n- The tarball unpacks a release/ directory (release/Install, release/lib, etc), should it unpack to a directory with a more specific name? or simply to “.”?\r\n\r\n- macOS ships with libressl but without header files and it's recommended to bring your own SSL library anyway so we statically link it. See: https://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/33696323211/wherein-i-write-apples-technote-about-openssl-on.\r\n\r\n- No consideration for wx

requires that the behavior module is built before the module we're compiling, and that it can be found in the build system's code path (which may have no relation to the host system). This is very annoying to deal with so we've decided to remove it as `dialyzer` already does this check in a far better fashion than the linter.\r\n\r\nThe only thing `dialyzer` lacks is that it doesn't understand the `behavior_info/1` callback (and raises a warning to that effect), but we consider that less important than fixing this issue. We can fix that separately should it become a problem.","created_at":"2020-12-08T11:09:53Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T07:45:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0eba29e095b9e031e53cf96faa86dc31e3da378","assignee":{"login":"jhogberg","id":28707369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzA3MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28707369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg","html_url":"https://github.com/jhogberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jhogberg","id":28707369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzA3MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28707369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg","html_url":"https://github.com/jhogberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhogberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

is the second pull request to address [ERL-1323](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-1323) following #2863, this time making the `erl` and `start` scripts independent of their actual location. This allows the Erlang installation directory to be moved freely on Unix-like systems.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to find the absolute path of the script from within itself, as was mentioned in the initial [ERL-1323](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-1323) discussion, thus allowing to set ROOTDIR dynamically when needed. It supports the 2 copies of each script, the ones in erts-%VSN%/bin and the ones in bin.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the usage and configuration of FINAL_ROOTDIR is kept as-is for full backwards compatibility with the existing installation scripts. It should be possible to remove FINAL_ROOTDIR totally in a second stage if this new dynamic approach proves to be robust enough on all supported systems, which I expect to be the case.\r\n\r\nI've tested the updated `erl` script a lot and I've applied exactly the same change to the `start` script but I don't use `start` myself. So feel free to have a second look at the potential impacts / side effects for `start` users.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts and feedback about this proposition.\r\n\r\nThanks, Jérôme","created_at":"2020-11-22T13:35:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T18:35:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1127fc4f2cf24379448a0ab634f1cc4d8550734b","assignee":{"login":"kjellwinblad","id":200374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDM3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad","html_url":"https://github.com/kjellwinblad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kjellwinblad","id":200374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDM3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad","html_url":"https://github.com/kjellwinblad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Assigned

is a way to parse simple arbitrary binary packet protocols\r\nwhere the length field is not the first field. Packet specs consist of a\r\nlist of [ 'u8' | 'u16' | u16le' | 'u32' | 'u32le' | 'varint' ]. The last\r\nfield listed is the length of the payload. Fields before the final field\r\ncontribute to the header length. Fixed length footers can be described\r\nwith the `{packet_spec_extra_bytes, non_neg_integer()}` option.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this new feature?**\r\n\r\nErlang's built in packet parser currently supports big-endian length-prefixed packets, ASN.1 BER packets, CORBA packets, SUN RPC packets, HTTP packets, etc. However there are many packet formats that *almost* work with Erlang's existing packet parser. For example many packets have a fixed length leader before the length field, or have a little-endian length field. This feature is an attempt to provide a simple way to delegate packet parsing of simple binary packets that are not simply big-endian length prefixed to the packet parser.\r\n\r\n**Risks or uncertain artifacts?**\r\n\r\nI could use guidance on the best way to implement some of this, especially how the `packet_spec` struct is initialized and passed around and how the prim_inet changes should look. I believe the feature itself is not a risk because it does not allow unbounded or infinite packets and does not consume unbounded memory.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve it?**\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the patch, a new packet mode and 2 new packet options have been added. I tried to avoid any dynamic allocation and do everything on the stack, although I am not sure this is correct as it is an optional feature. Additionally I added special encoding for the packet_spec in prim_inet and I'm not sure that is the correct approach.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this feature is useful.

:)\r\n\r\nI have gathered all monospace font settings in one place and left only the `monospace` font specification. This gives two benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Every OS will now display the default monospace font that is more familiar to the users.\r\n2. If a user sets their favourite monospace font in browser settings, it will now be displayed in Erlang documentation as well.\r\n\r\nI have also set the size of code block font the same as paragraph monospace font. Now all fonts have the same size.\r\n\r\nHere's how the new style looks on major

support for usrsctplib. Any feedback appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to use usrsctplib from within the emulator using `gen_sctp` as for the current SCTP support.\r\nBut this makes the SCTP stack run within the beam.\r\nThis mainly enabled me to have SCTP on macOS without running unsigned sctp kernel extensions.\r\nIt might also be possible to get usrsctplib support to work on windows.\r\nI have only tested on macOS and Linux.\r\n\r\nSome modifications has been made to usrsctp which can be found on below github repo and branch. I.e. passing already opened raw sockets to the lib and event callback support when socket is ready.\r\nhttps://github.com/falkevik/usrsctp/tree/event_callback_support\r\n\r\nSo how to try it.\r\nFirst install the usrsctplib from the above branch.\r\nWhen done you can enable usrsctp support when configuring otp.\r\n`./configure --enable-sctp=usrsctp` should start looking for the usrsctp header.\r\n\r\nWhen done and compiled as usual.\r\nOn Linux you can go with adding cap_net_raw; `setcap cap_net_raw+ep /path/to/beam.smp`.\r\nOn macOS I pass already opened raw sockets as arguments to the beam.\r\nNew flags are `+zsctp_raw_ipv4 <fd>` `+zsctp_raw_ipv6 <fd>` `+zsctp_raw_route <fd>`\r\nsetuid_socket_warp can be used for this, which is slightly modified to set additional options on the raw socket before dropping privileges.\r\n`setuid_socket_wrap -t +zsctp_raw_ipv4,sctp -T +zsctp_raw_ipv6,sctp -z +zsctp_raw_route,sctp`\r\n\r\nSo to the actual code changes, the idea is that when not enabled it should not affect at all.\r\nThis need extra code review I think, there a lot of `#ifdef`s that might have ended up badly.\r\n\r\nThere are some other changes that I need feedback on how to do it properly.\r\nSince we don't have any real file descriptor that we can put in the` select`/`poll` I register a callback when socket is ready to be read.\r\nWhen this callback is invoked, I check if the socket are in active mode or not.\r\nIf it is in active mode, the port are scheduled to be run `erts_port_task_schedule` as select would have done if the fd was ready.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use this call from the inet_drv driver I had to make them available from somewhere.\r\nCurrently in `erts/emulator/sys/common/erl_sys_common_misc.c`, where to put this kind of code?\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-22T09:46:46Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T10:30:42Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"40ba49de411da1e1929a27ffba898149ee024a88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356873828,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTY4NzM4Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/stalled","name":"stalled","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":"waiting
