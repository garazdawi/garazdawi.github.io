This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.\n* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.\n* **SSL**:\n * Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification\n* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\n * `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\n* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.\n* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.\n Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for existing code\n* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\n* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.\n* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\n* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\n* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\n* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\n* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\n functions are:\n * `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.\n* `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.\n The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\n* **kernel**: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\n* Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.\n \nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0.readme)\n \nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0.exe)\n \nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0/doc](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0/doc)\n The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\n [https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n \n","author":"Kenneth","attachment":"abs","tags":["release","OTP 23"]},{"id":"139","title":"OTP 23 Release Candidate 3","article_date":1587513600000,"lead":"The last release candidate for OTP 23","frontmatter":{"id":"139","title":"OTP 23 Release Candidate 3","lead":"The last release candidate for OTP 23","tags":"releasecandidate","article_date":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2020-05-11T08:05:11Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T08:05:11Z","admin_user_id":"3","visible":"true","article_type_id":"3"},"content":" ## OTP 23 Release Candidate 3\n \nThis is the third and last of three planned release candidates before the OTP 23 release.\n The intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. **All feedback is welcome**, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\n \nErlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.\n ### Highlights (rc3)\n \nApart from the changes below, this third pre-release contains only minor fixes.\n ### Potential Incompatibilities\n * SSL: * Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.\n* TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.\n* `erl_interface`: Removed the deprecated parts of `erl_interface`\n (`erl_interface.h` and essentially all C functions with prefix `erl_`).\n* The deprecated `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace.\n `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\n* ...\n ### Highlights (rc2)\n * **ssh**: * OpenSSH 6.5 introduced a new file representation of\n keys called `openssh-key-v1`.

pull request adds support for maps in the sets module. According to my [benchmarks](https://github.com/josevalim/sets_bench), using maps is faster in the majority of cases, sometimes by multiple orders of magnitude, and in the few cases it is slower, it is only by 1.1x-1.4x, which can be improved with the steps outlined below. Note that, although we are using maps, the type is still opaque.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFully adopting EEP 50 will require multiple PRs. In particular, following PRs should:\r\n\r\n1. Remove cerl_sets\r\n\r\n2. Incorporate the intersection implementation in #2797\r\n\r\n2. Write intersection, subtract, is_subset, is_disjoint, and from_list as NIFs so `sets` becomes the fastest set implementation in OTP on all possible

is a first step to address [ERL-1323](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-1323) by allowing **ROOTDIR** passed as an environment variable in both the _erl_ and _start_ commands. I've followed exactly the same approach and shell syntax as already used for **RELDIR** in [start.src](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/erts/etc/unix/start.src)\r\n\r\nIn the context of [ERL-1323,](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-1323) this small commit fixes a concrete issue on Android, as it finally allows to run Erlang/OTP on recent OS versions for which it's not possible to know in advance the absolute path of the Erlang runtime anymore. Being able to pass the install location via the **ROOTDIR** environment variable at runtime solves the issue in this case.\r\n\r\nI've tested this approach on the following https://github.com/JeromeDeBretagne/erlanglauncher/ project to finally implement the support for multiple users and I can confirm it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nThanks,

PR is a follow-up to #2791 which adds 4 new functions to the `queue` module. The new functions perform the same tasks as their counterparts in the `lists` module, but avoid the need to convert queues to lists first, which is both inconvenient and inefficient.\r\n\r\n* `queue:all/2`: like `lists:all/2`, checks if all items in a queue satisfy a predicate; processed in queue order to retain the order of side effects of the predicate function\r\n* `any/2`: like `lists:any/2`, checks if at least one item in a queue satisfies a predicate; procesed in queue order to retain the order of side effects of the predicate function\r\n* `delete/2`: like `lists:delete/2`, removes the _first_ occurence of an item from a queue, according to queue order\r\n* `delete_r/2`: there is no counterpart for this in the `lists` module, but I believe this function is still handy in a queue context; it removes the _last_ occurence of an item from a queue, according to queue order; the naming `..._r` has been chosen to follow the naming convention of other \"from the rear\" functions of the module, namely `in_r` and `out_r`\r\n\r\nIn #2791, @okeuday requested another function that removes the first/last item from a queue matching a predicate. Suggested naming was `remove/2`, IIRC. While this may be handy and could be added to this PR, I'm not sure what the consensus was, as such a function is not present in the `lists` module.

think?","created_at":"2020-11-03T13:54:19Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T16:28:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"685d1cb08c8dd69c681c7b21666ffb42657927cd","assignee":{"login":"RaimoNiskanen","id":189373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/189373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen","html_url":"https://github.com/RaimoNiskanen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"RaimoNiskanen","id":189373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/189373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen","html_url":"https://github.com/RaimoNiskanen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356265357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjUzNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:PS","name":"team:PS","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/issues/2850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/statuses/1e5052b050090a029d0f9db98a46c5bd169e93f4","head":{"label":"Maria-12648430:queue_more_functions","ref":"queue_more_functions","sha":"1e5052b050090a029d0f9db98a46c5bd169e93f4","user":{"login":"Maria-12648430","id":67057258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDU3MjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/67057258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430","html_url":"https://github.com/Maria-12648430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302273494,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDIyNzM0OTQ=","name":"otp","full_name":"Maria-12648430/otp","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Maria-12648430","id":67057258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDU3MjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/67057258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430","html_url":"https://github.com/Maria-12648430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/org

commit is the reference implementation for EEP-54, which proposes a mechanism\r\nfor providing more informational messages than simply \"bad argument\" when a call\r\nto a BIF fails. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n    1> element(a, b).\r\n    ** exception error: bad argument\r\n         in function  element/2\r\n            called as element(a,b)\r\n            *** argument 1: not an integer\r\n            *** argument 2: not a tuple\r\n\r\nAll the details are found in EEP-54, but here are the main points:\r\n\r\n* An extension of the format of the call-stack back trace (**stacktrace**) format\r\n  to indicate that there exists extended error information for that call, and\r\n  a convention for how extended error information can be provided.\r\n\r\n* A new `erlang:error/3` BIF to allow libraries and applications to\r\n  raise an exception with extended error information.\r\n\r\n* New functions `erl_error:format_exception/3` and\r\n  `erl_error:format_exception/4` to allow libraries and application to\r\n  format stacktraces in the same style as the shell.\r\n\r\nThis implementation of EEP-54 implements extended error information for all\r\nC-implemented BIFs in the `erlang` and `ets` modules.","created_at":"2020-11-03T13:42:53Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T09:14:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d44a658d38a5f8bdf2b6150458ea8d8545e4a16b","assignee":{"login":"bjorng","id":74840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/74840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng","html_url":"https://github.com/bjorng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bjorng","id":74840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/74840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng","html_url":"https://github.com/bjorng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356267348,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjczNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"7159f7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":386423799,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzODY0MjM3OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/testing","name":"testing","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":"currently

pretty printer of floats may round the float value before printing\r\nas long as the following property holds (X is a float value):\r\n\r\nX=:=erlang:list_to_float(lists:flatten(io_lib:format(\"~w\",[X]))).\r\n\r\nThis commit makes sure that the rounded digit always appear last, or\r\njust before e if the float is printed using scientific notation. This\r\nis accomplished by always printing using scientific notation if the\r\nnumber is so large that it might be rounded before the fractional\r\npart.\r\n\r\nBefore this commit, users could see the following in the Erlang shell:\r\n\r\n> 36028797018963970.0.\r\n36028797018963970.0\r\n> 36028797018963970.0 == 36028797018963970.\r\nfalse\r\n> 36028797018963970.0 == 36028797018963968.\r\ntrue\r\n\r\n36028797018963970.0 is represented as the float value\r\n36028797018963968.0 but the pretty printer rounds it to\r\n36028797018963970.0 as all numbers in the range [36028797018963966.0,\r\n36028797018963972.0] are represented by the float value\r\n36028797018963968.0. However, this can be confusing to users\r\n(https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-1308) as it is difficult to guess\r\nthat this is what is happening.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, the above example becomes as follows:\r\n\r\n> 36028797018963968.0.\r\n3.602879701896397e16\r\n> 3.602879701896397e16 == 36028797018963970.\r\nfalse\r\n> 3.602879701896397e16 == 36028797018963968.\r\ntrue\r\n\r\nWhich is less confusing because it is natural to think that the last\r\ndigit of a pretty printed float value can be rounded.","created_at":"2020-10-27T13:19:23Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T11:18:21Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4563c875220b4904c9cb750e8f0fc2465d95375a","assignee":{"login":"kjellwinblad","id":200374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDM3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/200374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad","html_url":"https://github.com/kjellwinblad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kjellwinblad","id":200374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDM3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/200374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad","html_url":"https://github.com/kjellwinblad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjellwinblad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356265674,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjU2NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"ddddee","default":true,"description":null},{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":386423799,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzODY0MjM3OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/testing","name":"testing","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":"currently

PR enables EDoc to output EEP-48 style doc chunks. The work leading to this PR was so far discussed and documented at https://github.com/erlef/documentation-wg/issues/4, whereas developed at https://github.com/erszcz/edoc.\r\n\r\nI tried to address all points raised in the discussions so far:\r\n1. Chunks are written to disk as standalone files, not embedded into `.beam` files.\r\n1. It's possible to generate chunks from the command line by running a script.\r\n1. The chunks are as close to `erl_docgen` chunks as possible (with the caveat of type links described below).\r\n1. All `@spec` and `@type` tags are rewritten to `-spec` and `-type` attributes, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the type link caveat with @garazdawi - `erl_docgen` chunk links to types do not use type arities. This means links to `t/0` and `t/1` have the same form. EDoc chunks do not follow this principle, since it seemed more robust to allow linking to arbitrary types. Until this is fixed for `erl_docgen` chunks, measures have to be taken in 3rd party tools (e.g. ExDoc) to watch for this difference.\r\n\r\nSome features stemming from EDoc design and implementation, but not necessarily intuitive, are not addressed in this PR:\r\n1. Function doc comments can precede or follow `-spec` attributes, but type doc comments must follow `-type` attributes.\r\n1. `@since` and `@deprecated` tags are supported on functions, but are not supported on types or callbacks.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `test/eep48_SUITE.erl` which tests the majority of the newly added functionality, as well as some of the above points which are currently not

3 macros: CAR, CDR and CONS with better more typesafe and read/write const-safe inlines.\r\nGathering OTP team opinion whether this is a good idea, and whether I should do more like this.\r\nIf the idea is liked, this opens way for more similar changes:\r\n\r\n* Cleaner `Eterm` API: list ops, binary ops, small int ops, atom ops...\r\n* Abstract away bit ops on terms, hiding bit ops from the logic and making the logic cleaner and safer.\r\n* Prevent bugs when an integer is passed/received unintentionally, which is not an Eterm\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/288724/92940800-d6b4fa80-f44f-11ea-95e8-43ae63e88fb0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n* Renames old style `CAR`, `CDR` to `cell_head` and `cell_tail` which reads easier.\r\n* Ensures that `Eterm*` and `Eterm` goes in/returns `Eterm` and `Eterm*`. Some compile time checks on types, and sizes.\r\n* Has some `const` safety (more in the future changes). The user has to choose whether the `list_cell` will be writable or not.\r\n* Debugging separate functions is also more pleasant (more debug info, stepping in, seeing locals), than macros.\r\n* Should not affect the performance, but could (see Cons below).\r\n\r\n## Cons (not CONS)\r\n\r\n* While `Eterm` is identical to an integer, the type safety is not yet enforced. But it is possible also to replace `Eterm` with a single field struct. This can give it strong type and prevents confusing it with integers.\r\n* This potentially could affect the performance, should be investigated. On small code examples in Godbolt's Compiler Explorer the assembly coming from the inline code looks identical to macros.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-11T14:54:32Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T07:24:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8242a7107c7694ba383dbf4becd5536b54adfaf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/issues/2746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/statuses/5dcd1f00e09f981e208667adcb862f7aa7514307","head":{"label":"kvakvs:codequality/CAR-CDR-CONS-to-inline","ref":"codequality/CAR-CDR-CONS-to-inline","sha":"5dcd1f00e09f981e208667adcb862f7aa7514307","user":{"login":"kvakvs","id":288724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/288724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs","html_url":"https://github.com/kvakvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":25250274,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTI1MDI3NA==","name":"otp","full_name":"kvakvs/otp","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kvakvs","id":288724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/288724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs","html_url":"https://github.com/kvakvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kvakvs/otp","description":"Erlang/OTP","fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.

Mix and Rebar allow some applications to be absent\r\nat runtime - sometimes also known as optional dependencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, given optional applications are not stored in .app\r\nresource files, releases do not consider optional applications\r\nin its boot order, leaving it up to chance if an optional app\r\nwill be started before its parent.\r\n\r\nUsers can try to explicitly list optional applications on their\r\nrelease definition files, but given the order is not enforced,\r\nthis manual specification may be reordered when new apps\r\nare added, leaving developers with broken releases.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the \"optional_applications\" field to .app\r\nresource files. This field must be a subset of the \"applications\"\r\nfield. The reason why it is a subset rather than its own list\r\nof applications is exactly to keep application start order\r\non \"application:start/2\" and during releases.\r\n\r\nIf application \"b\" is an optional application for application \"a\",\r\nand application \"b\" is missing, \"application:start(a)\" will still\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nIf application \"b\" is an optional application for application \"a\",\r\nand application \"b\" is available, \"application:ensure_all_started(a)\"\r\nwill automatically start application \"b\" before

behaviour of `include_lib` of first trying the same resolution\r\nas `inlcude` is unintuitive and error prone. Most users expect the two\r\noptions to behave in different ways - `include` to include headers from\r\ncurrent application/project and `include_lib` to include public headers\r\nfrom other applications.\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviuor can easily result in erronous behaviour where a wrong\r\nheader is included in complex repositories with convoluted structure.\r\n\r\nTo combat this issue, a new epp and compiler option `strict_include_lib`\r\nis introduced that separates behaviour of `include` and `include_lib`\r\ninto the one described above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf this is generally accepted

PR does a couple of things to `dbg`:\r\n\r\n* It adds a new tracer sink for `logger`. So it is now possible to do `dbg:tracer(logger)` to start tracing to logger instead. These log events have the domain `[otp,runtime_tools,dbg]` which means that they will not show up in the default log unless the default filters are modified.\r\n* Printing of terms using the device sink (i.e. the one for stdout) has been modified to take the width of the terminal into consideration. Also \"smart\" new-lines are added to avoid printouts that were terrible to read.\r\n* The default `dbg` process sink has been re-written to use the `logger_olp` module instead of relying on suspending processes. This will make the `dbg` sink kill itself if it is overloaded.\r\n\r\nThings left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] documentation about `logger` integration and options to `logger_olp`\r\n- [ ] testcases for

opening this before adding tests (still have to find where `i` and includes are tested) and the command line argument for `erlc` to get feedback and make sure this is an acceptable direction.\r\n\r\n`ia` and `iz` are meant to act like `pa` and `pz` but instead of or code path they prepend or append include paths. The issue with `i` is it only allows appending (so acts the same as `iz` but I added `iz` to be consistent with `pa`/`pz` and didn't remove `i` to stay backwards compatible).

is almost complete. What remains:\r\n\r\n1. Adding support for 32-bit bs_start_match3. Currently it just emits code equivalent to the 64-bit emulator code.\r\n2. Remove any trace of bs_start_match2 throughout the HiPE compiler, barring objection from maintainers.\r\n3. Refactor my bs_start_match3 handling code. I copied a number of existing functions and modified them slightly to suit my immediate interests. This is messy and needs to be replaced. What this refactor looks like depends on whether or not we remove bs_start_match2 support from HiPE.\r\n4. Thoroughly test this feature to ensure this generated code is not going to cause issues.\r\n\r\nI will try to get 32-bit support up tomorrow. In the meantime, let me know what the feeling is on bs_start_match2 getting tossed from HiPE. It is of little cost to keep it, it just affects how I refactor things a little.","created_at":"2019-05-28T06:45:17Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T10:30:34Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d80a2bb2124ec4376c0e9bd84be321ec402c085b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356265674,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjU2NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"ddddee","default":true,"description":null},{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":399744182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTk3NDQxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/waiting","name":"waiting","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":"waiting

is a way to parse simple arbitrary binary packet protocols\r\nwhere the length field is not the first field. Packet specs consist of a\r\nlist of [ 'u8' | 'u16' | u16le' | 'u32' | 'u32le' | 'varint' ]. The last\r\nfield listed is the length of the payload. Fields before the final field\r\ncontribute to the header length. Fixed length footers can be described\r\nwith the `{packet_spec_extra_bytes, non_neg_integer()}` option.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this new feature?**\r\n\r\nErlang's built in packet parser currently supports big-endian length-prefixed packets, ASN.1 BER packets, CORBA packets, SUN RPC packets, HTTP packets, etc. However there are many packet formats that *almost* work with Erlang's existing packet parser. For example many packets have a fixed length leader before the length field, or have a little-endian length field. This feature is an attempt to provide a simple way to delegate packet parsing of simple binary packets that are not simply big-endian length prefixed to the packet parser.\r\n\r\n**Risks or uncertain artifacts?**\r\n\r\nI could use guidance on the best way to implement some of this, especially how the `packet_spec` struct is initialized and passed around and how the prim_inet changes should look. I believe the feature itself is not a risk because it does not allow unbounded or infinite packets and does not consume unbounded memory.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve it?**\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the patch, a new packet mode and 2 new packet options have been added. I tried to avoid any dynamic allocation and do everything on the stack, although I am not sure this is correct as it is an optional feature. Additionally I added special encoding for the packet_spec in prim_inet and I'm not sure that is the correct approach.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this feature is useful. I wrote a blog post detailing the motivations behind it in more detail here:

:)\r\n\r\nI have gathered all monospace font settings in one place and left only the `monospace` font specification. This gives two benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Every OS will now display the default monospace font that is more familiar to the users.\r\n2. If a user sets their favourite monospace font in browser settings, it will now be displayed in Erlang documentation as well.\r\n\r\nI have also set the size of code block font the same as paragraph monospace font. Now all fonts have the same size.\r\n\r\nHere's how the new style looks on major

support for usrsctplib. Any feedback appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to use usrsctplib from within the emulator using `gen_sctp` as for the current SCTP support.\r\nBut this makes the SCTP stack run within the beam.\r\nThis mainly enabled me to have SCTP on macOS without running unsigned sctp kernel extensions.\r\nIt might also be possible to get usrsctplib support to work on windows.\r\nI have only tested on macOS and Linux.\r\n\r\nSome modifications has been made to usrsctp which can be found on below github repo and branch. I.e. passing already opened raw sockets to the lib and event callback support when socket is ready.\r\nhttps://github.com/falkevik/usrsctp/tree/event_callback_support\r\n\r\nSo how to try it.\r\nFirst install the usrsctplib from the above branch.\r\nWhen done you can enable usrsctp support when configuring otp.\r\n`./configure --enable-sctp=usrsctp` should start looking for the usrsctp header.\r\n\r\nWhen done and compiled as usual.\r\nOn Linux you can go with adding cap_net_raw; `setcap cap_net_raw+ep /path/to/beam.smp`.\r\nOn macOS I pass already opened raw sockets as arguments to the beam.\r\nNew flags are `+zsctp_raw_ipv4 <fd>` `+zsctp_raw_ipv6 <fd>` `+zsctp_raw_route <fd>`\r\nsetuid_socket_warp can be used for this, which is slightly modified to set additional options on the raw socket before dropping privileges.\r\n`setuid_socket_wrap -t +zsctp_raw_ipv4,sctp -T +zsctp_raw_ipv6,sctp -z +zsctp_raw_route,sctp`\r\n\r\nSo to the actual code changes, the idea is that when not enabled it should not affect at all.\r\nThis need extra code review I think, there a lot of `#ifdef`s that might have ended up badly.\r\n\r\nThere are some other changes that I need feedback on how to do it properly.\r\nSince we don't have any real file descriptor that we can put in the` select`/`poll` I register a callback when socket is ready to be read.\r\nWhen this callback is invoked, I check if the socket are in active mode or not.\r\nIf it is in active mode, the port are scheduled to be run `erts_port_task_schedule` as select would have done if the fd was ready.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use this call from the inet_drv driver I had to make them available from somewhere.\r\nCurrently in `erts/emulator/sys/common/erl_sys_common_misc.c`, where to put this kind of
