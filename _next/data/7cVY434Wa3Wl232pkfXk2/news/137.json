Below follows some highlights.\n### Highlights\n* ssl/public_key: * Implementation of the key and initialization vector\n update feature, and general hardening of TLS 1.3.\n There are cryptographic limits on the amount of\n plaintext which can be safely encrypted under a given set of keys.\n This change enforces those limits by triggering\n automatic key updates on TLS 1.3 connections.\n* Add support for TLS 1.3 Session Tickets (stateful and\n stateless). This allows session resumption using keying\n material from a previous successful handshake.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and\n PSS-RSA padding in signature verification.\n* erts: * A socket \"registry\" has been added making it possible to list current open sockets.\n* Add a \"full featured\" version of getifaddrs in the net module.\n* ssh: * The new functions ssh:set_sock_opts/2 and ssh:get_sock_opts/2 sets and reads option values for\n the underlying TCP stream.\n* Changes to the internal api of the experimental `ssh_dbg` tool.\n* common_test: The ct_property_test has now a report function for\n results of stateful testing.\n* stdlib: * Implement uri_string:resolve/{2,3} that can be used to\n resolve a URI reference against a base URI.\n* In gen_statem it is now possible to change the callback\n module for a running server. See gen_statem's\n documentation for�`change_callback_module`,\n `push_callback_module`, and�`pop_callback_module`.\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.3.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.3.readme)\n Pre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.3.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.3.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.3.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.3.exe)\n Online documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/doc/search/](http://erlang.org/doc/search/)\n The source tarball can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.3.tar.gz](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.3.tar.gz)\n The documentation can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.3.tar.gz](http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.3.tar.gz)\n The man pages can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.3.tar.gz](http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.3.tar.gz)\n The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:\n [https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n OTP-22.3\n\nThank you for all your contributions!\n","tags":["release"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
