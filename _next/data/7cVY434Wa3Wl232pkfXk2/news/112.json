Could be a bug, an unexpected incompatibility, a significant change of characteristics in negative direction, etc.\n\nErlang/OTP 20.0 is a new major release with new features, quite a few (characteristics) improvements, as well as a few incompatibilities.\n  \n\nHere are some of the most important news:\n## Potential Incompatibilities\n* ERTS:\n * The non SMP Erlang VM is deprecated and not built by default\n* Remove deprecated `erlang:hash/2`\n* erlang:statistics/1 with scheduler_wall_time now also includes info about dirty CPU schedulers.\n* The new purge strategy introduced in OTP 19.1 is mandatory and slightly incompatible for processes holding funs\n see `erlang:check_process_code/3`.\n* The NIF library reload is not supported anymore.\n* Asn1: Deprecated module and functions removed (`asn1rt`, `asn1ct:encode/3` and `decode/3`)\n* Ssh: client only option in a call to start a daemon will now fail\n## Highlights\n### Erts:\n* Dirty schedulers enabled and supported on VM with SMP support.\n* support for “dirty” BIFs and “dirty” GC.\n* erlang:garbage_collect/2 for control of minor or major GC\n* Erlang literals are no longer copied when sending messages.\n* Improved performance for large ETS tables, >256 entries (except ordered_set)\n* erlang:system_info/1 atom_count and atom_limit\n* Reduced memory pressure by converting sub-binaries to heap-binaries during GC\n* enif_select, map an external event to message\n### Compiler:\n* Code generation for complicated guards is improved.\n* Warnings for repeated identical map keys. `#{'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'a'=>3}` will warn for the repeated key `a`.\n* By default there is now a warning when `export_all` is used. Can be disabled\n* Pattern matching for maps is optimized\n* New option `deterministic` to omit path to source + options info the BEAM file.\n* Atoms may now contain arbitrary unicode characters.\n* `compile:file/2` has an option to include extra chunks in the BEAM file.\n### Misc other applications\n* Unnamed ets tables optimized\n* A new event manager to handle a subset of OS signals in Erlang\n* Optimized sets add_element, del_element and union\n* Added `rand:jump/0-1`\n* When a `gen_server` crashes, the stacktrace for the client will be printed to facilitate debugging.\n* `take/2` has been added to `dict`, `orddict`, and `gb_trees`.\n* `take_any/2` has been added to `gb_trees`\n* Significantly updated string module with unicode support\n* `erl_tar` support for long path names and new file formats\n* Dtls: Documented API, experimental\n* SSH: improving security, removing and adding algorithms\n* New `math:fmod/2`\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.0-rc1.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.0-rc1.readme)\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_20.0-rc1.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_20.0-rc1.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_20.0-rc1.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_20.0-rc1.exe)\n\nOn line documentation can be browsed here:\n [www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-9.0-rc1/doc/](http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-9.0-rc1/doc/)\n\nThanks to all contributors.\n","tags":["release"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
