This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.\n* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.\n* **SSL**:\n * Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification\n* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\n * `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\n* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.\n* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.\n Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for existing code\n* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\n* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.\n* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\n* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\n* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\n* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\n* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\n functions are:\n * `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.\n* `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.\n The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\n* **kernel**: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\n* Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions.

PR introduces two improvements to the `rand` module:\r\n* The possibility to seed using the current default algorithm, alias `default`\r\n* Two functions that generate binaries: `bytes/1` and `bytes_s/2`\r\n\r\nStating a `default` algorithm has been deemed not needed since when you seed to reproduce a sequence, you must state the algorithm to determine the sequence.  There is at least one scenario, though, when this does not apply; when you _export_ the start seed (to be able to reproduce the sequence) before generating a sequence, and is happy with whatever algorithm that is the default.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `seed/1`, `seed/2`, `seed_s/1` and `seed_s/2` accept the algorithm alias `default` for the default algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe new functions `bytes(N)` and `bytes_s(N, State)` generate a `binary()` of size `N`.  This is convenient precisely when you need a random binary, with the other properties that comes with the `rand` module such as reproducability and independence of the Crypto

PR implements the early data feature on the client side. Two new ssl options have been added ```early_data``` and ```max_early_data```. On the client side ```early_data``` is a ```binary()``` to be sent as early_data in a 0-RTT handshake. ```max_early_data``` configures the maximum size of early data accepted by the server. In this early version only the server's session ticket message has been updated to reflect the configured limit on the early data size.\r\n\r\nSample usage with automatic ticket handling:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Start openssl s_server\r\nopenssl s_server -accept 11029 \\\r\n\t-tls1_3 -verify 2 \\\r\n\t-cert certs/server.pem \\\r\n\t-CAfile certs/ca.pem \\\r\n\t-key certs/server.key \\\r\n\t-keylogfile keylog \\\r\n\t-msg -debug \\\r\n\t-early_data \\\r\n        -no_anti_replay\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nearly_data_auto() -\u003e\r\n    %% First handshake

early_data.\r\nThe API message has the following format: ```{ssl, SslSocket, {early_data, Result}}```.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n1\u003e

`proplists` (usually used in older projects/dependencies) from/to `maps` (used in more recent projects) is usually done with `maps:from_list/1`. Generally, you want to use `maps:get/2,3` (or pattern matching) then instead of `proplists:get_value/2,3`.\r\n\r\nA conversion via `maps:from_list/1` is fragile in several ways here:\r\n* proplists may contain single atoms as shorthand for `{Atom, true}`. `maps:from_list/1` cannot handle this.\r\n* proplists may even contain _any_ term besides single atoms and key-value 2-tuples. They are accepted and ignored by the proplists API, but `maps:from_list/1` cannot handle those.\r\n* proplists may contain the same keys multiple times with different values, and `proplists:get_value/2,3` will return the _first_ such value for a key. A map created from such a list via `maps:from_list/1` will contain the _last_ value for a key.\r\n\r\nThe `proplists:to_map/1` function introduced with this PR addresses the cases outlined above:\r\n* (key-value 2-tuples will be converted to `Key =\u003e Value` associations, as usual).\r\n* single atoms in the list will be expanded and appear in the map as `Atom =\u003e true`.\r\n* any other terms are silently ignored and won't appear in the map at all; in general, it might be appropriate to raise a `badarg` exception here, but since the proplists API accepts and just ignores them, this function necessarily follows suit.\r\n* if a key appears multiple times, the _first_ value will be in the result map, not the _last_, so `maps:get/2,3` on the created map yields the same result as would `proplists:get_value/2,3` on the proplist it was created from.\r\n\r\nWhile `proplists` offers functions to access _all_ values of properties with the same key (`get_all_values/2`, `lookup_all/2`), this is not possible with a map, at least not without taking out all the conveniences you get by using a map in the first place. But if you were using `maps:from_list/1` before for this purpose, you got only single values anyway, just not necessarily the ones you wanted ;)\r\n\r\nThe other function in this PR, `proplists:from_map/1`, creates a proplist from a map, which is just `maps:to_list/1`. This function is only there for symmetry.","created_at":"2020-12-04T15:27:45Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T23:43:50Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"998b56ce64889454fc9b9f8da71157b0bd09aaac","assignee":{"login":"RaimoNiskanen","id":189373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/189373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen","html_url":"https://github.com/RaimoNiskanen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"RaimoNiskanen","id":189373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/189373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen","html_url":"https://github.com/RaimoNiskanen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaimoNiskanen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/issues/2910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/statuses/2ef37a4a09d275c2559e097c7f8bafcd97012466","head":{"label":"Maria-12648430:proplists_maps","ref":"proplists_maps","sha":"2ef37a4a09d275c2559e097c7f8bafcd97012466","user":{"login":"Maria-12648430","id":67057258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDU3MjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/67057258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430","html_url":"https://github.com/Maria-12648430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302273494,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDIyNzM0OTQ=","name":"otp","full_name":"Maria-12648430/otp","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Maria-12648430","id":67057258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDU3MjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/67057258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430","html_url":"https://github.com/Maria-12648430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maria-12648430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/

has an option `file_suffix` for generating module files with different file extensions than the default `\".html\"`, e.g. `\".htm\"`. The generated module index (`modules-frame.html`) did not consider the different file suffix and always used `\".html\"`, so the links did not work at all. This is fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\n\u003chr /\u003e\r\n\r\nJudging from `git blame`, this option was introduced in 2009 and has been broken ever since.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the application of this option is incomplete, as only the module files are generated according to this option, but not the overview, the module index itself, and the index (frameset) files. While it appears to be safe to apply the file suffix option to the overview and module index as well, I'm not sure about the index (frameset), as this seems to be used for linking between applications.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason to assume that nobody has ever been seriously using this option (I only happened to notice this bug while working on something different). It _may_ be used in some way or other, but probably only if the generated module files are processed/used further in other ways, not to generate a complete, ready-to-deliver documentation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I put it up to discussion if this option should not be removed from the `edoc` documentation. Removal from the code may not be feasible, or even impossible, so I'm not suggesting

is the second pull request to address [ERL-1323](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-1323) following #2863, this time making the `erl` and `start` scripts independent of their actual location. This allows the Erlang installation directory to be moved freely on Unix-like systems.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to find the absolute path of the script from within itself, as was mentioned in the initial [ERL-1323](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-1323) discussion, thus allowing to set ROOTDIR dynamically when needed. It supports the 2 copies of each script, the ones in erts-%VSN%/bin and the ones in bin.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the usage and configuration of FINAL_ROOTDIR is kept as-is for full backwards compatibility with the existing installation scripts. It should be possible to remove FINAL_ROOTDIR totally in a second stage if this new dynamic approach proves to be robust enough on all supported systems, which I expect to be the case.\r\n\r\nI've tested the updated `erl` script a lot and I've applied exactly the same change to the `start` script but I don't use `start` myself.

PR enables EDoc to output EEP-48 style doc chunks. The work leading to this PR was so far discussed and documented at https://github.com/erlef/documentation-wg/issues/4, whereas developed at https://github.com/erszcz/edoc.\r\n\r\nI tried to address all points raised in the discussions so far:\r\n1. Chunks are written to disk as standalone files, not embedded into `.beam` files.\r\n1. It's possible to generate chunks from the command line by running a script.\r\n1. The chunks are as close to `erl_docgen` chunks as possible (with the caveat of type links described below).\r\n1. All `@spec` and `@type` tags are rewritten to `-spec` and `-type` attributes, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the type link caveat with @garazdawi - `erl_docgen` chunk links to types do not use type arities. This means links to `t/0` and `t/1` have the same form. EDoc chunks do not follow this principle, since it seemed more robust to allow linking to arbitrary types. Until this is fixed for `erl_docgen` chunks, measures have to be taken in 3rd party tools (e.g. ExDoc) to watch for this difference.\r\n\r\nSome features stemming from EDoc design and implementation, but not necessarily intuitive, are not addressed in this PR:\r\n1. Function doc comments can precede or follow `-spec` attributes, but type doc comments must follow `-type` attributes.\r\n1. `@since` and `@deprecated` tags are supported on functions, but are not supported on types or callbacks.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `test/eep48_SUITE.erl` which tests the majority of the newly added functionality, as well as some of the above points which are currently not

3 macros: CAR, CDR and CONS with better more typesafe and read/write const-safe inlines.\r\nGathering OTP team opinion whether this is a good idea, and whether I should do more like this.\r\nIf the idea is liked, this opens way for more similar changes:\r\n\r\n* Cleaner `Eterm` API: list ops, binary ops, small int ops, atom ops...\r\n* Abstract away bit ops on terms, hiding bit ops from the logic and making the logic cleaner and safer.\r\n* Prevent bugs when an integer is passed/received unintentionally, which is not an Eterm\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/288724/92940800-d6b4fa80-f44f-11ea-95e8-43ae63e88fb0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n* Renames old style `CAR`, `CDR` to `cell_head` and `cell_tail` which reads easier.\r\n* Ensures that `Eterm*` and `Eterm` goes in/returns `Eterm` and `Eterm*`. Some compile time checks on types, and sizes.\r\n* Has some `const` safety (more in the future changes). The user has to choose whether the `list_cell` will be writable or not.\r\n* Debugging separate functions is also more pleasant (more debug info, stepping in, seeing locals), than macros.\r\n* Should not affect the performance, but could (see Cons below).\r\n\r\n## Cons (not CONS)\r\n\r\n* While `Eterm` is identical to an integer, the type safety is not yet enforced. But it is possible also to replace `Eterm` with a single field struct. This can give it strong type and prevents confusing it with integers.\r\n* This potentially could affect the performance, should be investigated. On small code examples in Godbolt's Compiler Explorer the assembly coming from the inline code looks identical to macros.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-11T14:54:32Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T07:24:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8242a7107c7694ba383dbf4becd5536b54adfaf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":356263938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYyNjM5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/labels/team:VM","name":"team:VM","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/2746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/issues/2746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/erlang/otp/statuses/5dcd1f00e09f981e208667adcb862f7aa7514307","head":{"label":"kvakvs:codequality/CAR-CDR-CONS-to-inline","ref":"codequality/CAR-CDR-CONS-to-inline","sha":"5dcd1f00e09f981e208667adcb862f7aa7514307","user":{"login":"kvakvs","id":288724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/288724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs","html_url":"https://github.com/kvakvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":25250274,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTI1MDI3NA==","name":"otp","full_name":"kvakvs/otp","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kvakvs","id":288724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/288724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs","html_url":"https://github.com/kvakvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvakvs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kvakvs/otp","description":"Erlang/OTP","fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kvakvs/otp/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.

Mix and Rebar allow some applications to be absent\r\nat runtime - sometimes also known as optional dependencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, given optional applications are not stored in .app\r\nresource files, releases do not consider optional applications\r\nin its boot order, leaving it up to chance if an optional app\r\nwill be started before its parent.\r\n\r\nUsers can try to explicitly list optional applications on their\r\nrelease definition files, but given the order is not enforced,\r\nthis manual specification may be reordered when new apps\r\nare added, leaving developers with broken releases.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the \"optional_applications\" field to .app\r\nresource files. This field must be a subset of the \"applications\"\r\nfield. The reason why it is a subset rather than its own list\r\nof applications is exactly to keep application start order\r\non \"application:start/2\" and during releases.\r\n\r\nIf application \"b\" is an optional application for application \"a\",\r\nand application \"b\" is missing, \"application:start(a)\" will still\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nIf application \"b\" is an optional application for application \"a\",\r\nand application \"b\" is available, \"application:ensure_all_started(a)\"\r\nwill automatically start application \"b\" before

behaviour of `include_lib` of first trying the same resolution\r\nas `inlcude` is unintuitive and error prone. Most users expect the two\r\noptions to behave in different ways - `include` to include headers from\r\ncurrent application/project and `include_lib` to include public headers\r\nfrom other applications.\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviuor can easily result in erronous behaviour where a wrong\r\nheader is included in complex repositories with convoluted structure.\r\n\r\nTo combat this issue, a new epp and compiler option `strict_include_lib`\r\nis introduced that separates behaviour of `include` and `include_lib`\r\ninto the one described above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf this is generally accepted

PR does a couple of things to `dbg`:\r\n\r\n* It adds a new tracer sink for `logger`. So it is now possible to do `dbg:tracer(logger)` to start tracing to logger instead. These log events have the domain `[otp,runtime_tools,dbg]` which means that they will not show up in the default log unless the default filters are modified.\r\n* Printing of terms using the device sink (i.e. the one for stdout) has been modified to take the width of the terminal into consideration. Also \"smart\" new-lines are added to avoid printouts that were terrible to read.\r\n* The default `dbg` process sink has been re-written to use the `logger_olp` module instead of relying on suspending processes. This will make the `dbg` sink kill itself if it is overloaded.\r\n\r\nThings left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] documentation about `logger` integration and options to `logger_olp`\r\n- [ ] testcases for

opening this before adding tests (still have to find where `i` and includes are tested) and the command line argument for `erlc` to get feedback and make sure this is an acceptable direction.\r\n\r\n`ia` and `iz` are meant to act like `pa` and `pz` but instead of or code path they prepend or append include paths. The issue with `i` is it only allows appending (so acts the same as `iz` but I added `iz` to be consistent with `pa`/`pz` and didn't remove `i` to stay backwards compatible). This leaves `.` as always the first directory that includes are looked for from.\r\n\r\nRebar3 does not change the working directory when building dependencies, or for applications if they live in `apps/\u003cappname\u003e` instead of at the top level, and this causes issues when a dependency and the root have includes with the same name.

is a way to parse simple arbitrary binary packet protocols\r\nwhere the length field is not the first field. Packet specs consist of a\r\nlist of [ 'u8' | 'u16' | u16le' | 'u32' | 'u32le' | 'varint' ]. The last\r\nfield listed is the length of the payload. Fields before the final field\r\ncontribute to the header length. Fixed length footers can be described\r\nwith the `{packet_spec_extra_bytes, non_neg_integer()}` option.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this new feature?**\r\n\r\nErlang's built in packet parser currently supports big-endian length-prefixed packets, ASN.1 BER packets, CORBA packets, SUN RPC packets, HTTP packets, etc. However there are many packet formats that *almost* work with Erlang's existing packet parser. For example many packets have a fixed length leader before the length field, or have a little-endian length field. This feature is an attempt to provide a simple way to delegate packet parsing of simple binary packets that are not simply big-endian length prefixed to the packet parser.\r\n\r\n**Risks or uncertain artifacts?**\r\n\r\nI could use guidance on the best way to implement some of this, especially how the `packet_spec` struct is initialized and passed around and how the prim_inet changes should look. I believe the feature itself is not a risk because it does not allow unbounded or infinite packets and does not consume unbounded memory.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve it?**\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the patch, a new packet mode and 2 new packet options have been added. I tried to avoid any dynamic allocation and do everything on the stack, although I am not sure this is correct as it is an optional feature. Additionally I added special encoding for the packet_spec in prim_inet and I'm not sure that is the correct approach.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this feature is useful.

:)\r\n\r\nI have gathered all monospace font settings in one place and left only the `monospace` font specification. This gives two benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Every OS will now display the default monospace font that is more familiar to the users.\r\n2. If a user sets their favourite monospace font in browser settings, it will now be displayed in Erlang documentation as well.\r\n\r\nI have also set the size of code block font the same as paragraph monospace font. Now all fonts have the same size.\r\n\r\nHere's how the new style looks on major

support for usrsctplib. Any feedback appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to use usrsctplib from within the emulator using `gen_sctp` as for the current SCTP support.\r\nBut this makes the SCTP stack run within the beam.\r\nThis mainly enabled me to have SCTP on macOS without running unsigned sctp kernel extensions.\r\nIt might also be possible to get usrsctplib support to work on windows.\r\nI have only tested on macOS and Linux.\r\n\r\nSome modifications has been made to usrsctp which can be found on below github repo and branch. I.e. passing already opened raw sockets to the lib and event callback support when socket is ready.\r\nhttps://github.com/falkevik/usrsctp/tree/event_callback_support\r\n\r\nSo how to try it.\r\nFirst install the usrsctplib from the above branch.\r\nWhen done you can enable usrsctp support when configuring otp.\r\n`./configure --enable-sctp=usrsctp` should start looking for the usrsctp header.\r\n\r\nWhen done and compiled as usual.\r\nOn Linux you can go with adding cap_net_raw; `setcap cap_net_raw+ep /path/to/beam.smp`.\r\nOn macOS I pass already opened raw sockets as arguments to the beam.\r\nNew flags are `+zsctp_raw_ipv4 \u003cfd\u003e` `+zsctp_raw_ipv6 \u003cfd\u003e` `+zsctp_raw_route \u003cfd\u003e`\r\nsetuid_socket_warp can be used for this, which is slightly modified to set additional options on the raw socket before dropping privileges.\r\n`setuid_socket_wrap -t +zsctp_raw_ipv4,sctp -T +zsctp_raw_ipv6,sctp -z +zsctp_raw_route,sctp`\r\n\r\nSo to the actual code changes, the idea is that when not enabled it should not affect at all.\r\nThis need extra code review I think, there a lot of `#ifdef`s that might have ended up badly.\r\n\r\nThere are some other changes that I need feedback on how to do it properly.\r\nSince we don't have any real file descriptor that we can put in the` select`/`poll` I register a callback when socket is ready to be read.\r\nWhen this callback is invoked, I check if the socket are in active mode or not.\r\nIf it is in active mode, the port are scheduled to be run `erts_port_task_schedule` as select would have done if the fd was ready.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use this call from the inet_drv driver I had to make them available from somewhere.\r\nCurrently in `erts/emulator/sys/common/erl_sys_common_misc.c`, where to put this kind of
