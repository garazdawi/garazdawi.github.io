Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.\n##  Highlights\n###  Erts:\n* Enhanced IO scalability\n* Support for usage of distribution controller processes for alternative transports, routing etc\n* compact instructions on 64bit systems for code below 4GB 20% less memory for loaded code\n* Rewrite of the efile-driver with NIFs and \"Dirty schedulers\" resulting in faster file operations\n* non-smp VM removed\n* link and monitor optimized for scalability\n* os:getenv/putenv now work on thread-safe emulation. No longer in sync with libc getenv(3). Manual synchronization will be needed.\n### Compiler:\n* Misc compiler optimizations including contributions from the Elixir team resulting in 10% improvements in benchmarks\n* \"Tuple calls\" have been removed from the run-time system.\n* Code such as `f({ok, Val}) -> {ok, Val}` is now automatically rewritten to `f({ok, Val} = Tuple) -> Tuple.` this reduces code size, execution time, and removed GC pressure.\n* More information in stacktrace from a number of operators\n* `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` deprecated to be replaced with `try ... catch C:R:Stacktrace -> ...`\n* Creation of small maps with literal keys optimized.\n### Security:\n* DTLS support in SSL\n* Enhanced support for distribution over TLS\n* \"unsecure\" ciphers removed from defaults in SSL and SSH.\n* A new option value defined to facilitate implementing exec servers.
