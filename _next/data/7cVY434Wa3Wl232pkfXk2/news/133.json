To fix this bug the communication protocol between mnesia nodes had to be updated, thus mnesia will no longer be able to connect to nodes earlier than mnesia-4.14 ,first realeased in OTP-19.0.\n* Stdlib: Debugging of time-outs in gen_statem has been improved. Starting a time-out is now logged in sys:log and sys:trace. Running time-outs are visible in server crash logs, and with sys:get_status. Due to this system events {start_timer, Action, State} and {insert_timout, Event, State} have been added, which may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events. New features: The EventContent of a running time-out can be updated with {TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}. Running time-outs can be cancelled with {TimeoutType, cancel} which is more readable than using Time = infinity.{rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}.\n## Highlights\n### Compiler:\n* erlc can now automatically use a compile server to avoid starting an Erlang system for each file to be compiled in a multi-file project. See the documentation for how to enable it.\n### Standard libraries:\n* SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Client for experimental use. For more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the User's Guide.\n* crypto: The Message Authentication Codes (MAC) CMAC, HMAC and Poly1305 are unified into common functions in the New Crypto API. See the manual for CRYPTO. cipher_info/1 functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.\n\n \n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.readme)\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.1.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.1.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.1.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.1.exe)\n\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/doc/search/](http://erlang.org/doc/search/)\n\nThe source tarball can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.tar.gz](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.tar.gz)\n The documentation can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.1.tar.gz](http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.1.tar.gz)\n The man pages can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.1.tar.gz](http://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.1.tar.gz)\n\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:\n\n[https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n\n[OTP-22.1](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-22.1)\n\n \n\nThank you for all your contributions!\n","tags":["release"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
