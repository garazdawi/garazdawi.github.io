For individual lookups,\n<code>gb_sets</code> and \"maps as sets\" are preferred, although the latter has no\nofficial API in Erlang/OTP. If you need a mixed profile, the best choice\nbecomes blurrier. Note there is also a <code>sets</code> module, but it is rarely a\nviable option.</p>\n\n<p>The current landscape with sets is not much different than the dictionary\nlandscape before Erlang/OTP 17. Luckily, once <code>maps</code> were added, <code>maps</code>\nbecame the <em>de facto</em> dictionary in Erlang. The other dictionary-like\nmodules may perform better under limited occasions but <code>maps</code> provide\nthe best profile in many scenarios and are a reasonable starting point\n(until a need for benchmarking and profiling arises - if it ever arises).</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this EEP is to propose a map-based sets solution with a group\nof BIFs that will give developers a sets implementation that can be\ngenerally treated as the main set implementation in Erlang/OTP.</p>\n\n<h1>Rationale</h1>\n\n<p>Dictionaries and sets implementation tend to walk side-by-side. Such as\n<code>ordsets</code> and <code>orddict</code>, <code>gb_trees</code> and <code>gb_sets</code>. That's because you can\nconsider elements in a set to be keys in a dictionary, where you don't care\nabout the value for the keys.</p>\n\n<p>Given we have dictionaries implemented as maps, could we have sets based\non maps? The answer is yes and there are two approaches. The first approach\nis to provide a native data structure, implemented in C, with its own\nsyntax.  The advantage of said approach would be lower memory usage,\nbut it has a large impact on the language and on the runtime. Therefore\nthat's not the approach we will pursue here.</p>\n\n<p>The second approach, which this EEP advocates for, is to implement <code>sets</code>\non top of maps, as done by <code>cerl_sets</code>. In this scenario, the sets elements\nare keys in the map and the values are empty lists (we chose empty lists\nbecause they are very cheap to serialize).</p>\n\n<p>Using \"maps as sets\" provide good performance characteristics today for\ninserting, adding and deleting set elements, being faster than all other\nimplementations. However, in terms of memory usage, \"maps as sets\" use\nalmost two times more memory than <code>ordsets</code> (although note that the set\noperations themselves may end-up using less memory). Compared to <code>gb_sets</code>,\n\"maps as sets\" use less memory altogether.</p>\n\n<p>But can \"maps as sets\" be as fast as <code>ordsets</code> for unions, intersections and\nsubtractions?</p>\n\n<p>The good news is: <strong>this is already true for unions</strong>, which is equivalent\nto <code>maps:merge/2</code>. Benchmarks are available in the addendum and we can take\nthe following conclusions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>when unioning integers elements, maps and ordsets take roughly the same\ntime, with maps slightly ahead except in cases where we have to go from\nsmall maps to large maps</p></li>\n<li><p>when unioning tuples elements, maps are consistently faster, sometimes\n2 to 4 times, except in cases where we have to go from small maps to\nlarge maps. This is expected, the more expensive it becomes to compare\nitems, the more expensive <code>ordsets</code> become</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This means that, if we could implement intersection and subtraction on top\nof maps, then it will likely be more efficient than ordsets, since\nintersection and subtraction do not have the issue of map resizing.</p>\n\n<p>A proof of concept was written for intersections using small and mixed maps\nwith positive results (see benchmarks in addendum). We can also see the new\nintersections are consistently faster than <code>cerl_sets</code>. Unfortunately there\nare no benchmarks for intersections between two large maps due to lack of C\nexpertise of this EEP author. The assumption, which should be verified, is\nthat intersecting large maps will be faster than intersecting large\n<code>ordsets</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Given the results seen in <code>maps:merge/2</code> and the fact that map resizing does\nnot happen on intersections, this assumption will likely turn out to be\ntrue.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if our goal is to make <code>maps</code> as fast as <code>ordsets</code> for those\noperations, we need to implement new BIFs.</p>\n\n<h1>Specification</h1>\n\n<p>\"maps as sets\" are generally more efficient than the existing set\nimplementations for checking, adding and deleting elements. However,\nthey are slower than <code>ordsets</code> in the following operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>from_list/1</code></li>\n<li><code>is_subset/2</code></li>\n<li><code>is_disjoint/2</code></li>\n<li><code>intersection/2</code></li>\n<li><code>subtract/2</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, if we want to have a <em>de facto</em> set implementation, the functions\nabove would have to implemented as BIFs. The first three provide only\npartial speed-ups compared to a pure Erlang implementation but the last two\noperations with provide drastic gains as NIFs. The last two operations\nare also the most complex to implement.</p>\n\n<p>With the changes above, the only operations in \"maps as sets\" that won't be\nas fast or faster than \"ordsets\" is <code>to_list</code> and <code>fold</code>, since <code>ordsets</code>\nare lists internally.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming the functionality above is validated as more performant (at least\nfor intersections and subtractions) and there is an interest in providing\nsaid functionality, the last question is: how should this functionality be\nexposed?</p>\n\n<h1>Possible APIs for \"maps as sets\"</h1>\n\n<h3>1. Augment the maps module</h3>\n\n<p>If there is no interest in adding new module to OTP, the \"maps\" module could\nbe augmented to have set-based operations. In those cases, only the keys are\ncompared. The values can come from either the first or the second map.</p>\n\n<p>While this approach will improve performance, the <code>intersection/2</code> and\n<code>subtract/2</code> APIs in <code>maps</code> are quite awkward. One alternative is to prefix\nthose operations with the <code>key</code> prefix, such as <code>keyintersection</code>,\nto make it clear they are about the intersection of keys. But perhaps\na better approach altogether is to define a separate module.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Add <code>mapsets</code> module</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>mapsets</code> module provide sets based on maps. The fact said sets are\nbased on maps is part of the public API (i.e. they are not an opaque type),\nexactly like <code>ordsets</code>. The value for each key is the empty list to make\nsure sets can be cheapily serialized.</p>\n\n<p>This new module would have 5 BIFs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>mapsets:from_list/1</code></li>\n<li><code>mapsets:intersection/2</code></li>\n<li><code>mapsets:is_subset/2</code></li>\n<li><code>mapsets:is_disjoint/2</code></li>\n<li><code>mapsets:subtract/2</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The remaining APIs would be implemented on top of the maps API.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Change the <code>sets</code> module</h3>\n\n<p>Another option, similar to the above, is to leverage the fact the <code>sets</code>\ntype is opaque and replace its implementation by \"maps as sets\". The\nadvantages of this approach is that everyone using <code>sets</code> today would get\na performance upgrade and we would avoid adding a new module to Erlang/OTP.\nAfter all, there is always a risk that by adding a fourth option that\nunifies all three existing options, we will simply end-up with four options.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of this approach is that, although the <code>sets</code> datastructure is\nopaque, developers may have serialized it elsewhere, and therefore the\nexisting data structure must still be supported. This means we would first\nneed to modify the <code>sets</code> module to support both old sets and the new\n\"maps as sets\".  Support for the old data structure can be removed only\nin future versions. We would also need to discuss an appropriate\nmigration path.</p>\n\n<h1>Next Steps</h1>\n\n<p>At the current stage, the proposal is a draft and not fully specified. In\nparticular, it is necessary to validate the implementation of some\noperations and benchmark them. It is also necessary to choose a relevant\nAPI for the propose functionality.</p>\n\n<p>That said, if this proposal is viewed positively, the proposed next steps\nare:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Validate that intersections with maps is faster than with ordsets</p></li>\n<li><p>Choose the desired API for \"maps as sets\" (i.e. choose between 1.\n extending <code>maps</code>, 2. adding <code>mapsets</code>, or 3. changing <code>sets</code>)</p></li>\n<li><p>Implement the chosen API in Erlang (most of the <code>cerl_sets</code>\n implementation can be leveraged)</p></li>\n<li><p>Optimize the relevant operations as BIFs</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The author of the EEP can help by implementating step 3.</p>\n\n<h1>Copyright</h1>\n\n<p>This document has been placed in the public domain.</p>\n\n<p>[VimVar]: &lt;> \" vim: set fileencoding=utf-8 expandtab shiftwidth=4\nsofttabstop=4: \"</p>\n\n<h1>Addendum: Union benchmark results</h1>\n\n<h3>Unioning sets of integers</h3>\n\n<pre><code>Operating System: macOS\nCPU Information: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8259U CPU @ 2.30GHz\nNumber of Available Cores: 8\nAvailable memory: 16 GB\nElixir 1.9.0\nErlang 23-master\n\nBenchmark suite executing with the following configuration:\nwarmup: 2 s\ntime: 5 s\nmemory time: 0 ns\nparallel: 1\nEstimated total run time: 8.40 min\n\n##### With input a1 Interspersed (5) #####\nName                      ips        average  deviation         median\n    99th %\n1 maps:merge           4.18 M      239.50 ns ±13926.78%           0 ns\n   1000 ns\n3 ordsets:union        2.73 M      365.68 ns  ±8833.12%           0 ns\n   1000 ns\n2 gb_sets:union        0.99 M     1008.99 ns  ±2897.13%        1000 ns\n   2000 ns\n\nComparison:\n1 maps:merge           4.18 M\n3 ordsets:union        2.73 M -
