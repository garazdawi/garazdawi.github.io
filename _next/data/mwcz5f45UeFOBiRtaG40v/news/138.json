This is now supported with the exception of\n handling encrypted keys.\n* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file.\n This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that\n is disabled by default without need to change the code.\n* ssl: * Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake\n look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully\n establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in\n signature verification\n* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without\n relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a\n couple of new options to the inet distribution has been\n added. * `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution\n channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\n* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that\n the built-in EPMD client should return.\n* ...\n* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.\n Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for\n existing code\n### Highlights (rc1)\n* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\n* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.\n* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\n* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\n* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunneling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\n* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\n* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\n functions are: * `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a�`Module:Function/Arity`.\n* `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a�`Module:Type/Arity`.\n The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\n* kernel: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\n* Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.\n* ...\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0-rc2.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0-rc2.readme)\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0-rc2.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0-rc2.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0-rc2.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0-rc2.exe)\n\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc2/doc](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc2/doc)\n The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\n [https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n","tags":["release","candidate","testing"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
