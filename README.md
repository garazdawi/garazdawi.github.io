# Erlang.org website

Source code for the Erlang.org website.

The erlang.org website is written using typescript and
[next.js](http://www.nextjs.org) as a static site generator (SSG). The content of the website can be customized by editing the files in
[content](/content).

New blogposts, releases and EEPs are automatically pulled from their respective repositories.

## GITHUB_TOKEN

Since github rate-limits the REST API requests that you are allowed
to make from annonymous connections it is recommended that you set the
`GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in your shell to a valid [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Develop

The easiest way to setup a dev environment is to just use the makefile
and call `make`. This will update the correct git submodules and start
nodejs.

If you want to run node directly instead, you can run `make setup` and
then `npm run dev`.

## Deploy

All the pages are statically generated. To do that you can run `make export`
which will output the webpages to the out folder.

## Docker

There are dockerfiles that can be used to setup an nginx image that will
serve erlang-org at [http://localhost:3000]. To build run `make docker` and
to build and run do `make docker_run`.

## TODO

This this not a complete migration yet. This still needs to be done:
* RSS feeds (news, releases, blog)
* Github actions auto-deploy
* Better downloads integrated with versions tree
* Review HTML and CSS styling
  * use sass
  * update bootstrap version
* Migrate all news to markdown
