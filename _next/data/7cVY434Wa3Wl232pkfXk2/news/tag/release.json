This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.\n* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.\n* **SSL**:\n * Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification\n* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\n * `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\n* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.\n* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.\n Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for existing code\n* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\n* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.\n* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\n* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\n* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\n* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\n* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\n functions are:\n * `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.\n* `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.\n The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\n* **kernel**: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\n* Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions.

To fix this bug the communication protocol between mnesia nodes had to be updated, thus mnesia will no longer be able to connect to nodes earlier than mnesia-4.14 ,first realeased in OTP-19.0.\n* Stdlib: Debugging of time-outs in gen_statem has been improved. Starting a time-out is now logged in sys:log and sys:trace. Running time-outs are visible in server crash logs, and with sys:get_status. Due to this system events {start_timer, Action, State} and {insert_timout, Event, State} have been added, which may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events. New features: The EventContent of a running time-out can be updated with {TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}. Running time-outs can be cancelled with {TimeoutType, cancel} which is more readable than using Time = infinity.{rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}.\n## Highlights\n### Compiler:\n* erlc can now automatically use a compile server to avoid starting an Erlang system for each file to be compiled in a multi-file project. See the documentation for how to enable it.\n### Standard libraries:\n* SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Client for experimental use. For more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the User's Guide.\n* crypto: The Message Authentication Codes (MAC) CMAC, HMAC and Poly1305 are unified into common functions in the New Crypto API.

This does not apply to the ei library.\n* VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.\n## New Features\n### Erts:\n* Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large messages into several fragments.\n* ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.\n* The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it yields when called with long lists.\n* A new (still experimental) module socket is introduced. It is implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as \"close as possible\" to the OS level socket interface.\n* Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.\n### Compiler:\n* The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible. * The binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.\n* Type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.\n* All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.\n* In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support. If erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.\n### Standard libraries:\n* Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode.

All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you, as it lets us know that the release candidate got some testing.\n\nErlang/OTP 22 is a new major release with new features and improvements as well as incompatibilities.\n## Potential Incompatibilities\n* gen_* behaviours: If logging of the last N messages through sys:log/2,3 is active for the server, this log is included in the terminate report.\n* reltool: A new element, Opts, can now be included in a rel tuple in the reltool release specific configuration format: {rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}.\n* All external pids/ports/refs created by erlang:list_to_pid and similar functions now compare equal to any other pid/port/ref with same number from that node.\n* The old legacy erl_interface library is deprecated as of OTP 22, and will be removed in OTP 23. This does not apply to the ei library.\n* VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.\n## Additional highlights in release candidate 2\n* A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This is a low level API that does *not* replace gen_[tcp|udp|sctp]. It is intended to *eventually* replace the inet driver. It also provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of other protocols than TCP, UDP and SCTP. Known issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently), a small term leakage. This feature will be classed as experimental in OTP 22.\n* ssl: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Server for experimental use.\n* In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support. If erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.\n* erts: Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.\n* crypto: The new hash_info/1 and cipher_info/1 functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.\n## Highlights in release candidate 1\n### Erts:\n* Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large signals into several fragments.\n* ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.\n* The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it yields when called with long lists.\n* A new (still experimental) module socket is introduced. It is implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as \"close as possible\" to the OS level socket interface.\n### Compiler:\n* The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible. * The binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.\n* Type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.\n* All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.\n### Standard libraries:\n* Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode. The increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, as an example the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.\n* SSL now uses the new logger API, including log levels and verbose debug logging.\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc2.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc2.readme)\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.0-rc2.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.0-rc2.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.0-rc2.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.0-rc2.exe)\n\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc2/doc](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc2/doc)\n\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:\n\n[https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n\n[OTP-22.0-rc2](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-22.0-rc2)\n\n \n\nThank you for all your contributions!\n","tags":["releasecandidate","rc","release"]},{"id":"127","title":"Erlang OTP 21.3 is released","article_date":1552435200000,"lead":"Erlang/OTP 21.3 is the third service release containing mostly bug fixes and characteristics improvements but also a few features.","frontmatter":{"id":"127","title":"Erlang OTP 21.3 is released","lead":"Erlang/OTP 21.3 is the third service release containing mostly bug fixes and characteristics improvements but also a few features.","tags":"release","article_date":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2019-03-12T14:34:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T15:42:42Z","admin_user_id":"3","visible":"true","article_type_id":"3"},"content":"# OTP 21.3\n\nErlang/OTP 21.3 is the third service release for version 21 release with, improvements as well as a few features!\n## Highlights\n\nKernel:\n* The standard logger handler, logger_std_h, now has a new internal feature for log rotation.

This is now changed so that only atoms actually containing unicode characters are encoded with the UTF8 tags while other atoms are encoded `ATOM_EXT` just as before.\n\nHere are some of the most important news in OTP 20:\n## Potential Incompatibilities\n* ERTS:\n * The non SMP Erlang VM is deprecated and not built by default\n* Remove deprecated `erlang:hash/2`\n* erlang:statistics/1 with scheduler_wall_time now also includes info about dirty CPU schedulers.\n* The new purge strategy introduced in OTP 19.1 is mandatory and slightly incompatible for processes holding funs\n see `erlang:check_process_code/3`.\n* The NIF library reload is not supported anymore.\n* Atoms can now contain arbitrary unicode characters which means that the `DFLAG_UTF8_ATOMS` capability in the distribution protocol must be supported if an OTP 20 node should accept the connection with another node or library. Third party libraries which uses the distribution protocol need to be updated with this.\n* Asn1: Deprecated module and functions removed (`asn1rt`, `asn1ct:encode/3` and `decode/3`)\n* Ssh: client only option in a call to start a daemon will now fail\n## Highlights\n### Erts:\n* Dirty schedulers enabled and supported on VM with SMP support.\n* support for “dirty” BIFs and “dirty” GC.\n* erlang:garbage_collect/2 for control of minor or major GC\n* Erlang literals are no longer copied when sending messages.\n* Improved performance for large ETS tables, >256 entries (except ordered_set)\n* erlang:system_info/1 atom_count and atom_limit\n* Reduced memory pressure by converting sub-binaries to heap-binaries during GC\n* enif_select, map an external event to message\n* Improvements of timers internally in the VM resulting in reduced memory consumption and more efficient administration for timers\n### Compiler:\n* Code generation for complicated guards is improved.\n* Warnings for repeated identical map keys. `#{'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'a'=>3}` will warn for the repeated key `a`.\n* By default there is now a warning when `export_all` is used. Can be disabled\n* Pattern matching for maps is optimized\n* New option `deterministic` to omit path to source + options info the BEAM file.\n* Atoms may now contain arbitrary unicode characters.\n* `compile:file/2` has an option to include extra chunks in the BEAM file.\n### Misc other applications\n* Significantly updated `string` module with unicode support and many new functions\n* crypto now supports OpenSSL 1.1\n* Unnamed ets tables optimized\n* `gen_fsm` is deprecated and replaced by `gen_statem`\n* A new event manager to handle a subset of OS signals in Erlang\n* Optimized sets add_element, del_element and union\n* Added `rand:jump/0-1`\n* When a `gen_server` crashes, the stacktrace for the client will be printed to facilitate debugging.\n* `take/2` has been added to `dict`, `orddict`, and `gb_trees`.\n* `take_any/2` has been added to `gb_trees`\n* `erl_tar` support for long path names and new file formats\n* `asn1`: the new `maps` option changes the representation of `SEQUENCE` to be maps instead of records\n* A TLS client will by default call `public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2` to verify the hostname\n* `ssl`: DTLS documented in the API, experimental\n* `ssh`: improving security, removing and adding algorithms\n* New `math:fmod/2`\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.0.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.0-rc2.readme)\n\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\n [https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp) with tag OTP-20.0\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_20.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_20.0-rc2.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_20.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_20.0-rc2.exe)\n\nOn line documentation can be browsed here:\n [www.erlang.org/doc/](http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-9.0-rc2/doc/)\n\nThanks to all contributors.\n","tags":["release"]},{"id":"113","title":"Erlang/OTP 20.0-rc2 is available for testing","article_date":1496188800000,"lead":"Erlang/OTP Release Candidate 2 is available for testing","frontmatter":{"id":"113","title":"Erlang/OTP 20.0-rc2 is available for testing","lead":"Erlang/OTP Release Candidate 2 is available for testing","tags":"release","article_date":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2017-05-31T20:40:33Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T20:40:33Z","admin_user_id":"11","visible":"true","article_type_id":"3"},"content":"  # OTP 20 Release Candidate 2\n \nThis is the second of two release candidates before the OTP 20 release.
