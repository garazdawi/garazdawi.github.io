Release</a><br/><em>Written by <a href="/news/user/Kenneth">Kenneth</a>, <!-- -->Wednesday, 13 May 2020</em></div><div class="text-center"><img src="/upload/news/abs" class="img-rounded"/></div><p><div><h2>OTP 23</h2><p>Erlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.</p><h3>Potential Incompatibilities</h3><ul><li><strong>SSL</strong>: * Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.</li><li>TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.</li><li><code>erl_interface</code>: Removed the deprecated parts of <code>erl_interface</code> (<code>erl_interface.h</code> and essentially all C functions with prefix <code>erl_</code>).</li><li>The deprecated <code>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</code> BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace. <code>erlang:get_stacktrace/0</code> is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.</li></ul><h3>Improvements and new features</h3><ul><li><strong>ssh</strong>:</li><li>OpenSSH 6.5 introduced a new file representation of keys called <code>openssh-key-v1</code>. This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.</li><li>Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.</li><li><strong>SSL</strong>:</li><li>Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.</li><li>Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification</li><li>The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.</li><li><code>-dist_listen false</code> Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.</li><li><code>-erl_epmd_port Port</code> Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.</li><li>A first EXPERIMENTAL <code>socket</code> backend to</li></ul><p><code>gen_tcp</code> and <code>inet</code> has been implemented. <code>gen_udp</code> and <code>gen_sctp</code> will follow.
Putting <code>{inet_backend, socket}</code> as first option to <code>listen()</code> or <code>connect()</code> makes it easy to try this for existing code</p><ul><li>A new module <code>erpc</code> in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the <code>rpc</code> module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. <code>erpc</code> also has better performance and scalability than the original <code>rpc</code> implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced <code>spawn_request()</code> BIF. Also the <code>rpc</code> module benefits from these improvements by utilizing <code>erpc</code> when possible.</li><li>Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.</li><li>In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)</li><li>When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).</li><li>ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.</li><li>Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: <code>123_456_789</code>, <code>16#1234_ABCD</code>.</li><li>New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The</li></ul><p>functions are:</p><ul><li><code>h/1,2,3</code> -- Print the documentation for a <code>Module:Function/Arity</code>.</li><li><code>ht/1,2,3</code> -- Print the type documentation for a <code>Module:Type/Arity</code>.</li></ul><p>The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.</p><ul><li><strong>kernel</strong>: The module <code>pg</code> with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module <code>pg2</code> is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.</li><li>Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.</li></ul><p>For more details see

There are cryptographic limits on the amount of
plaintext which can be safely encrypted under a given set of keys.
This change enforces those limits by triggering
automatic key updates on TLS 1.3 connections.</p><ul><li>Add support for TLS 1.3 Session Tickets (stateful and</li></ul><p>stateless). This allows session resumption using keying
material from a previous successful handshake.</p><ul><li>Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and</li></ul><p>PSS-RSA padding in signature verification.</p><ul><li>erts: * A socket &quot;registry&quot; has been added making it possible to list current open sockets.</li><li>Add a &quot;full featured&quot; version of getifaddrs in the net module.</li><li>ssh: * The new functions ssh:set_sock_opts/2 and ssh:get_sock_opts/2 sets and reads option values for</li></ul><p>the underlying TCP stream.</p><ul><li>Changes to the internal api of the experimental <code>ssh_dbg</code> tool.</li><li>common_test: The ct_property_test has now a report function for</li></ul><p>results of stateful testing.</p><ul><li>stdlib: * Implement uri_string:resolve/{2,3} that can be used to</li></ul><p>resolve a URI reference against a base URI.</p><ul><li>In gen_statem it is now possible to change the callback</li></ul><p>module for a running server. See gen_statem&#x27;s
documentation for�<code>change_callback_module</code>,
<code>push_callback_module</code>, and�<code>pop_callback_module</code>.</p><p>For more details see

To fix this bug the communication protocol between mnesia nodes had to be updated, thus mnesia will no longer be able to connect to nodes earlier than mnesia-4.14 ,first realeased in OTP-19.0.</li><li>Stdlib: Debugging of time-outs in gen_statem has been improved. Starting a time-out is now logged in sys:log and sys:trace. Running time-outs are visible in server crash logs, and with sys:get_status. Due to this system events {start_timer, Action, State} and {insert_timout, Event, State} have been added, which may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events. New features: The EventContent of a running time-out can be updated with {TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}. Running time-outs can be cancelled with {TimeoutType, cancel} which is more readable than using Time = infinity.{rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}.</li></ul><h2>Highlights</h2><h3>Compiler:</h3><ul><li>erlc can now automatically use a compile server to avoid starting an Erlang system for each file to be compiled in a multi-file project. See the documentation for how to enable it.</li></ul><h3>Standard libraries:</h3><ul><li>SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Client for experimental use. For more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the User&#x27;s Guide.</li><li>crypto: The Message Authentication Codes (MAC) CMAC, HMAC and Poly1305 are unified into common functions in the New Crypto API. See the manual for CRYPTO. cipher_info/1 functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.</li></ul><p> </p><p>For more details see

This does not apply to the ei library.</li><li>VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.</li></ul><h2>New Features</h2><h3>Erts:</h3><ul><li>Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large messages into several fragments.</li><li>ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.</li><li>The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it yields when called with long lists.</li><li>A new (still experimental) module socket is introduced. It is implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as &quot;close as possible&quot; to the OS level socket interface.</li><li>Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.</li></ul><h3>Compiler:</h3><ul><li>The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible. * The binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.</li><li>Type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.</li><li>All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.</li><li>In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support. If erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.</li></ul><h3>Standard libraries:</h3><ul><li>Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode. The increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, as an example the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.</li><li>A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This is a low level API that does <em>not</em> replace gen_[tcp|udp|sctp]. It is intended to <em>eventually</em> replace the inet driver. It also provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of other protocols than TCP, UDP and SCTP. Known issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently), a small term leakage. This feature will be classed as experimental in OTP 22.</li><li>SSL: now uses the new logger API, including log levels and verbose debug logging.</li><li>SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Server for experimental use.</li><li>crypto: The new hash_info/1 and cipher_info/1 functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.</li></ul><p> </p><p>For more details see

The service release contains mostly bug fixes and characteristics improvements but also some new features.</p><p>Some highlights for 20.1</p><ul><li>crypto, public_key: Extend crypto and public_key functions sign and verify with:</li><li>support for RSASSA-PS padding for signatures and for</li></ul><p>saltlength setting</p><ul><li>X9.31 RSA padding.</li><li>sha, sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512 for dss</li></ul><p>signatures as mentioned in NIST SP 800-57 Part 1.</p><ul><li>ripemd160 to be used for rsa signatures.</li><li>A new tuple in <code>crypto:supports/0</code> reports supported MAC</li></ul><p>algorithms.</p><ul><li>diameter:</li><li>Add service option <code>decode_format</code> to allow incoming messages to be decoded into maps</li></ul><p>instead of records.</p><ul><li>Decode performance has been improved.</li><li>Add service/transport option avp_dictionaries to give better support for dictionaries only defining AVPs.</li><li>erts: Upgraded the ERTS internal PCRE library from version 8.40 to version 8.41.</li><li>erts, kernel, tools: Profiling with lock counting can now be fully toggled at runtime in</li></ul><p>the lock counting emulator (-emu_type lcnt). Everything
is enabled by default to match the old behavior, but
specific categories can be toggled at will with minimal
runtime overhead when disabled. Refer to the
documentation on�<code>lcnt:rt_mask/1</code> for details.</p><p><code>lcnt:collect</code> and�<code>lcnt:clear</code> will no longer block all
other threads in the runtime system. This makes it possible to run the lock counting
under heavier load.</p><ul><li>erts: The�<code>zlib</code> module has been refactored and all its operations will now yield appropriately,</li></ul><p>allowing them to be used freely in concurrent applications.</p><ul><li>erts, tools: Add�<code>erlang:iolist_to_iovec/1</code>, which converts an</li></ul><p><code>iolist()</code> to an�<code>erlang:iovec()</code>, which is suitable for use
with�<code>enif_inspect_iovec()</code>.</p><ul><li>erts: Add new nif API functions for managing an I/O Queue.</li></ul><p>The added functions are:�<code>enif_ioq_create()</code>,�<code>enif_ioq_destroy()</code>,�<code>enif_ioq_enq_binary()</code>,
<code>enif_ioq_enqv()</code>,�<code>enif_ioq_deq()</code>,�<code>enif_ioq_peek()</code>,�<code>enif_inspect_iovec()</code>,�<code>enif_free_iovec()</code></p><ul><li>observer/crashdump_viewer:</li><li>Reading of crash dumps with many binaries is optimized.</li><li>A progress bar is shown when the detail view for a process is opened.</li><li>The cdv script now sets ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=0 to</li></ul><p>avoid generating a new crash dump from the node running the Crashdump Viewer.</p><ul><li>observer:</li></ul><p>Add system statistics and limits to frontpage in
observer.</p><ul><li>public_key, ssl**:</li></ul><p>Improved error propagation and reports</p><ul><li>ssh: A new option�<code>modify_algorithms</code> is implemented. It</li></ul><p>enables specifying changes on the default algorithms
list. See the reference manual and the SSH User&#x27;s Guide
chapter &quot;Configuring algorithms in SSH&quot;.</p><ul><li>tools/xref: The predefined Xref analysis locals_not_used now understands</li></ul><p>the�<code>-on_load()</code> attribute and does not report unused functions.</p><ul><li>tools/fprof: When sampling multiple processes and analyzing</li></ul><p>with totals set to true, the output now sums together
all caller and callee entries which concerns the same
function. Previous behaviour was to report each
contributing entry separately.</p><p>You can find the README and the full listing of changes for this service release at</p><p><a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.1.readme">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.1.readme</a></p><p>The source distribution and binary distributions for Windows can be

This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.\n* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.\n* **SSL**:\n * Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification\n* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\n * `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\n* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.\n* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.\n Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for existing code\n* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\n* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.\n* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\n* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\n* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\n* Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\n* New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types.

This is now supported with the exception of\n handling encrypted keys.\n* Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file.\n This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that\n is disabled by default without need to change the code.\n* ssl: * Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake\n look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully\n establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\n* Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in\n signature verification\n* The possibility to run Erlang distribution without\n relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a\n couple of new options to the inet distribution has been\n added. * `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution\n channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\n* `-erl_epmd_port Port` Configure a default port that\n the built-in EPMD client should return.\n* ...\n* A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow.\n Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for\n existing code\n### Highlights (rc1)\n* A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\n* Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations.\n* In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\n* When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\n* ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunneling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented.

To fix this bug the communication protocol between mnesia nodes had to be updated, thus mnesia will no longer be able to connect to nodes earlier than mnesia-4.14 ,first realeased in OTP-19.0.\n* Stdlib: Debugging of time-outs in gen_statem has been improved. Starting a time-out is now logged in sys:log and sys:trace. Running time-outs are visible in server crash logs, and with sys:get_status. Due to this system events {start_timer, Action, State} and {insert_timout, Event, State} have been added, which may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events. New features: The EventContent of a running time-out can be updated with {TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}. Running time-outs can be cancelled with {TimeoutType, cancel} which is more readable than using Time = infinity.{rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}.\n## Highlights\n### Compiler:\n* erlc can now automatically use a compile server to avoid starting an Erlang system for each file to be compiled in a multi-file project. See the documentation for how to enable it.\n### Standard libraries:\n* SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Client for experimental use. For more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the User's Guide.\n* crypto: The Message Authentication Codes (MAC) CMAC, HMAC and Poly1305 are unified into common functions in the New Crypto API.

This does not apply to the ei library.\n* VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.\n## New Features\n### Erts:\n* Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large messages into several fragments.\n* ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.\n* The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it yields when called with long lists.\n* A new (still experimental) module socket is introduced. It is implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as \"close as possible\" to the OS level socket interface.\n* Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.\n### Compiler:\n* The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible. * The binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.\n* Type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.\n* All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.\n* In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support. If erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.\n### Standard libraries:\n* Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode. The increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, as an example the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.\n* A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This is a low level API that does *not* replace gen_[tcp|udp|sctp]. It is intended to *eventually* replace the inet driver. It also provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of other protocols than TCP, UDP and SCTP. Known issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently), a small term leakage.

This does not apply to the ei library.\n* VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.\n## Additional highlights in release candidate 2\n* A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This is a low level API that does *not* replace gen_[tcp|udp|sctp]. It is intended to *eventually* replace the inet driver. It also provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of other protocols than TCP, UDP and SCTP. Known issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently), a small term leakage. This feature will be classed as experimental in OTP 22.\n* ssl: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Server for experimental use.\n* In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support. If erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.\n* erts: Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.\n* crypto: The new hash_info/1 and cipher_info/1 functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.\n## Highlights in release candidate 1\n### Erts:\n* Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large signals into several fragments.\n* ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.\n* The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it yields when called with long lists.\n* A new (still experimental) module socket is introduced. It is implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as \"close as possible\" to the OS level socket interface.\n### Compiler:\n* The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible. * The binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.\n* Type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.\n* All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.\n### Standard libraries:\n* Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode. The increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, as an example the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.\n* SSL now uses the new logger API, including log levels and verbose debug logging.\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc2.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0-rc2.readme)\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.0-rc2.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.0-rc2.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.0-rc2.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.0-rc2.exe)\n\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\n [http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc2/doc](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc2/doc)\n\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:\n\n[https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp)\n\n[OTP-22.0-rc2](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-22.0-rc2)\n\n \n\nThank you for all your contributions!\n","tags":["releasecandidate","rc","release"]},{"id":"127","title":"Erlang OTP 21.3 is released","article_date":1552435200000,"lead":"Erlang/OTP 21.3 is the third service release containing mostly bug fixes and characteristics improvements but also a few features.","frontmatter":{"id":"127","title":"Erlang OTP 21.3 is released","lead":"Erlang/OTP 21.3 is the third service release containing mostly bug fixes and characteristics improvements but also a few features.","tags":"release","article_date":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2019-03-12T14:34:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T15:42:42Z","admin_user_id":"3","visible":"true","article_type_id":"3"},"content":"# OTP 21.3\n\nErlang/OTP 21.3 is the third service release for version 21 release with, improvements as well as a few features!\n## Highlights\n\nKernel:\n* The standard logger handler, logger_std_h, now has a new internal feature for log rotation.

Third party libraries which uses the distribution protocol need to be updated with this.\n* Asn1: Deprecated module and functions removed (`asn1rt`, `asn1ct:encode/3` and `decode/3`)\n* Ssh: client only option in a call to start a daemon will now fail\n## Highlights\n### Erts:\n* Dirty schedulers enabled and supported on VM with SMP support.\n* support for “dirty” BIFs and “dirty” GC.\n* erlang:garbage_collect/2 for control of minor or major GC\n* Erlang literals are no longer copied when sending messages.\n* Improved performance for large ETS tables, \u003e256 entries (except ordered_set)\n* erlang:system_info/1 atom_count and atom_limit\n* Reduced memory pressure by converting sub-binaries to heap-binaries during GC\n* enif_select, map an external event to message\n* Improvements of timers internally in the VM resulting in reduced memory consumption and more efficient administration for timers\n### Compiler:\n* Code generation for complicated guards is improved.\n* Warnings for repeated identical map keys. `#{'a'=\u003e1, 'b'=\u003e2, 'a'=\u003e3}` will warn for the repeated key `a`.\n* By default there is now a warning when `export_all` is used. Can be disabled\n* Pattern matching for maps is optimized\n* New option `deterministic` to omit path to source + options info the BEAM file.\n* Atoms may now contain arbitrary unicode characters.\n* `compile:file/2` has an option to include extra chunks in the BEAM file.\n### Misc other applications\n* Significantly updated `string` module with unicode support and many new functions\n* crypto now supports OpenSSL 1.1\n* Unnamed ets tables optimized\n* `gen_fsm` is deprecated and replaced by `gen_statem`\n* A new event manager to handle a subset of OS signals in Erlang\n* Optimized sets add_element, del_element and union\n* Added `rand:jump/0-1`\n* When a `gen_server` crashes, the stacktrace for the client will be printed to facilitate debugging.\n* `take/2` has been added to `dict`, `orddict`, and `gb_trees`.\n* `take_any/2` has been added to `gb_trees`\n* `erl_tar` support for long path names and new file formats\n* `asn1`: the new `maps` option changes the representation of `SEQUENCE` to be maps instead of records\n* A TLS client will by default call `public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2` to verify the hostname\n* `ssl`: DTLS documented in the API, experimental\n* `ssh`: improving security, removing and adding algorithms\n* New `math:fmod/2`\n\nFor more details see\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.0.readme](http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.0-rc2.readme)\n\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\n [https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp) with tag OTP-20.0\n\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_20.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_20.0-rc2.exe)\n [http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_20.0.exe](http://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_20.0-rc2.exe)\n\nOn line documentation can be browsed here:\n [www.erlang.org/doc/](http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-9.0-rc2/doc/)\n\nThanks to all contributors.\n","tags":["release"]},{"id":"113","title":"Erlang/OTP 20.0-rc2 is available for testing","article_date":1496188800000,"lead":"Erlang/OTP Release Candidate 2 is available for testing","frontmatter":{"id":"113","title":"Erlang/OTP 20.0-rc2 is available for testing","lead":"Erlang/OTP Release Candidate 2 is available for testing","tags":"release","article_date":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","created_at":"2017-05-31T20:40:33Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T20:40:33Z","admin_user_id":"11","visible":"true","article_type_id":"3"},"content":"  # OTP 20 Release Candidate 2\n \nThis is the second of two release candidates before the OTP 20 release.
