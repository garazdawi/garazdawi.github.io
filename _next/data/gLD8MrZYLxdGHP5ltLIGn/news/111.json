Please do not create a public issue for a security issue.\n## When should you report a security issue?\n\nThe risk level is often determined by a product of the impact once exploited, and the probability of exploitation occurring. In other words, if a bug can cause great damage, but it takes highest privilege to exploit the bug, then the bug is not a high risk one. Similarly, if the bug is easily exploitable, but its impact is limited, then it is not a high risk issue either.\n\n \n\nThere is not any hard and fast rule to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a security issue to **erlang-security [at] erlang [dot] org**. A general rule is that an attack by someone that has no access to the Erlang application or its system can affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability.\n\n \n## What happens after the report?\n\nAll security bugs in the Erlang/OTP distribution should be reported to **erlang-security [at] erlang [dot] org**. Your report will be handled by a small security team at the OTP team. Your email will be acknowledged as soon as we start handling the issue. \n\n \n\nPlease use a descriptive email title for your report. After the initial response to your report, the security team will keep you updated on the progress and decision being made towards a fix and release announcement. \n\n \n## Flagging Existing Issues as Security-related\n\nIf you believe that an existing public issue on [bugs.erlang.org](http://bugs.erlang.org/) is security-related, we ask that you send an email to **erlang-security [at] erlang [dot] org**. The email title should contain the issue ID on [bugs.erlang.org](http://bugs.erlang.org/) (e.g. Flagging security issue ERL-001). Please include a short description to motivate why it should be handled according to the security policy.\n","tags":["Erlang","OTP","security","report","bug"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
